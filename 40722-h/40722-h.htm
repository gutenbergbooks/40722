<br />A MISSING CUB</h2>
<p>Firelight splashed the eager faces of six Cub
Scouts, who squatted Indian fashion around the
glowing log.</p>
<p>Sam Hatfield, cubmaster of Den 2 at Webster
City, raised his hand in cheery greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; responded the Cubs. Expectantly, they
waited for their chief to speak.</p>
<p>On this particular night, the den meeting was
being held on a river slope directly behind the
home of Burton Holloway, one of the Den Dads.</p>
<p>As all the Cubs knew, the session was no ordinary
week-end ceremonial. For Mr. Hatfield had
promised that an important announcement would
be forthcoming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone here?&rdquo; The cubmaster&rsquo;s gaze roved
from one Cub to another as he started to call the
roll. &ldquo;Brad Wilber!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Present,&rdquo; drawled the Den Chief.</p>
<p>Brad was nearly 14, a Boy Scout and an acknowledged
leader among the younger Cubs. Mr. Hatfield
depended a great deal upon the dark-haired, serious
youngster, having found him to be even-tempered
and quick of wit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Carter!&rdquo; the cubmaster resumed the roll
call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; answered Dan with a friendly grin. He
was a sandy-haired boy, clever in school and a fine
athlete. All the Cubs liked him.</p>
<p>Next Mr. Hatfield called the name of his own
son, Fred, who replied with a loud &ldquo;How! Me heap
big Injun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roll call also included Mack Tibbets, Chips
Davis and Midge Holloway, a son of the Den Dad.
But when Red Suell&rsquo;s name was spoken, he did
not respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Red?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired. In the
flickering firelight he could not see the boys&rsquo; faces
distinctly. &ldquo;Not here yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late again,&rdquo; drawled Chips. &ldquo;You know Red.
He never can make a meeting on time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought he&rsquo;d be here tonight,&rdquo; said Brad. &ldquo;He
had something special on his mind. Fact is, I&rsquo;m
a little bothered about it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming down the hill now,&rdquo; cut in
Dan. He directed attention toward a shadowy,
hurrying figure.</p>
<p>A moment later, Red, who had acquired the
nickname because of his fiery hair, breathlessly
joined the group. He carried a bulky object concealed
in a large paper bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time you&rsquo;re getting here!&rdquo; Chips scolded him.
&ldquo;What you got in that sack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing.&rdquo; Red grinned mysteriously.</p>
<p>Carefully holding together the top edges of the
bag so that none of the Cubs could see what it
held, he took his place in the circle.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield stirred the log with a stick, sending
up a shower of sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about to spin a few Indian stories,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;But first, now that we&rsquo;re all here, I&rsquo;ll
tell you about next month&rsquo;s den project. Ever hear
of the Navajos?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; chirped Chips, proud of his knowledge.
&ldquo;Blankets! We&rsquo;ve got some at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Cubs hooted in derision.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Navajos are Indians,&rdquo; corrected Dan. &ldquo;They
live on a large New Mexico reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;The Navajos
are very skillful at weaving blankets and making
silver ornaments, so Chips wasn&rsquo;t too far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the Navajos have to do with our project?&rdquo;
asked Mack Tibbets curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lot, I hope. I thought we might adopt a
Navajo Pack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do the Navajos have Cub Scout organizations?&rdquo;
demanded Red. In his surprise, he nearly dropped
the paper bag which he had kept so carefully
tucked under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should we adopt an Indian Pack?&rdquo; questioned
Midge Holloway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the Navajo youngsters need our help,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield explained. &ldquo;The government has aided
the Indians by setting up schools and providing
many necessities. But while some of the Navajos
are well off, others are very poor, depending almost
entirely upon sheep raising for a living. Their
dwellings are <i>hogans</i> or houses built of sticks, rock
and mud. Few have adequate clothing or shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do the Navajo Cubs need?&rdquo; asked Brad.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All sorts of things. Books, uniforms, craft articles
and especially money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield went on to say that if the Cubs
decided to adopt a Navajo Pack, cash might be
raised by various projects, including an Indian
pow-wow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that sounds swell to me!&rdquo; approved Dan
instantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; chimed in Midge Holloway.</p>
<p>All the other Cubs likewise voted in favor of
the project.</p>
<p>The matter decided, Mr. Hatfield related several
Indian stories. As the fire burned lower, the boys
huddled close together, for a chill had come upon
the summer night.</p>
<p>Unintentionally, Dan brushed against Red&rsquo;s mysterious
paper bag. He could tell by the feel that it
held something soft and warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you hiding, Red?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You
keep clutching that sack as if you&rsquo;re hanging onto
a live rabbit. What&rsquo;s in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bear maybe,&rdquo; grinned Red. &ldquo;Wait and see!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Remarking upon the darkness of the woods, he
stared fixedly toward the tall pine trees. His intensity
began to make the other Cubs feel a trifle
uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with you anyhow, Red?&rdquo; Dan
asked, losing impatience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Red returned innocently. &ldquo;Gosh, but
it&rsquo;s getting dark! Do you &rsquo;spose any wild animals
are out there in the woods watching our fire die
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably a mountain lion, six wolves and a
couple of bears,&rdquo; Dan retorted. &ldquo;All waiting to
attack! Don&rsquo;t try to stir our imaginations, Red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who me?&rdquo; Red demanded indignantly.</p>
<p>He subsided into silence. However, a few minutes
later, Dan heard him urge Mr. Hatfield to &ldquo;tell a
good scarey bear or wolf story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting rather late,&rdquo; the cubmaster rejoined.
&ldquo;Our wood is nearly gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get some more,&rdquo; Red offered eagerly.</p>
<p>Before anyone could stop him, he darted off into
the woods.</p>
<p>Instead of telling an animal story, Mr. Hatfield
explained the origin of the Navajo fire dance, or
mountain chant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>This spectacular Indian dance, he related, was
performed by the braves four or five times a year,
usually late in fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Navajos believe that bears and snakes are
evil spirits,&rdquo; the cubmaster remarked. &ldquo;If a Navajo
kills a bear, he fears that the animal&rsquo;s spirit may
enter his own body. So to free such an evil spirit
from the body, the Indian braves take part in the
fire dance ceremony which often lasts five days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan paid only scant attention as Mr. Hatfield
described the colorful dance. He kept watching the
fringe of woods for a glimpse of Red. Surely, the
boy had been gone long enough to return with an
armful of firewood!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s become of him?&rdquo; he whispered to Brad
who sat on his left in the circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be along soon enough,&rdquo; Brad shrugged.
&ldquo;Relax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield finished his description of the fire
dance. Mr. Holloway then told the Cubs of plans
which included the building of a Navajo trading
post, a <i>hogan</i> and perhaps the making of a sand
painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll practice canoeing too,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Fact
is, we&rsquo;re hoping to schedule a canoe race with Den
1 at the end of the season.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat &rsquo;em too!&rdquo; Midge announced proudly.
&ldquo;Dan and Brad are handy with a paddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is Ross Langdon of Den 1,&rdquo; Dan reminded
him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count our trophies until we win &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, keep in mind that winning isn&rsquo;t nearly as
important as good, friendly competition and fun,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield added. &ldquo;Now, shall we close the meeting
by the Cub Promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly the boys formed in a circle about the
dying embers of the fire. In unison they recited:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;I promise</p>
<p class="t0">To do my best</p>
<p class="t0">To do my duty to</p>
<p class="t0">God and my country,</p>
<p class="t0">To be square, and to obey the law of the Pack.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As the meeting broke up, Mr. Hatfield doused
water on the live coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of Red?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;He left camp
twenty minutes ago for more wood. He must have
gone to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably to get a head start at the refreshments,&rdquo;
chimed in Chips. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Red!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if he&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; Dan offered quickly. &ldquo;I
saw him disappear into the trees, but he may have
circled around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light glowed from the kitchen windows of the
Holloway house on the hill.</p>
<p>The dwelling stood at the extreme edge of the
metropolitan park area in the section which included
many acres of wild, almost virgin timber.
On many occasions the Cubs had been allowed to
use the Holloway cabin which fronted the river.
Often too, they explored the marked trails, usually
accompanied by either Mr. Holloway or the cubmaster.</p>
<p>Climbing the gravel path, Dan peered in at the
open kitchen door. In the glare of the electric light
he could see Mrs. Holloway setting a long table
with paper plates and napkins. Fragrant chocolate
simmered on the stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Dan,&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway greeted him
cordially. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the first Cub to come looking for
food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Red hasn&rsquo;t been here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking for him,&rdquo; Dan explained. &ldquo;Guess
he must be somewhere else.&rdquo; Without telling more,
he ran back to the river front to report to Mr.
Hatfield.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Hatfield and Midge&rsquo;s father were
troubled to learn that Red had not been found at
the house. Anxiously, they gazed toward the dark
woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s lost in there,&rdquo; Dan said, reading
their thought. &ldquo;I saw him start off that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield reached for a powerful flashlight
which he always kept ready for use. &ldquo;I thought
Red had more sense than to go beyond view of the
camp fire,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be very far
away though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s call to him,&rdquo; proposed Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;If
he&rsquo;s anywhere near, he&rsquo;ll hear us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men shouted Red&rsquo;s name repeatedly.
No answering cry came from the darkness. However,
the other Cubs gathered about, alarmed by
the disappearance of their den mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really my fault,&rdquo; Brad said, addressing the
two men. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have let him do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what, Brad?&rdquo; questioned Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;What
are you talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth is, Red planned to play a little joke
on the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A joke? What kind of joke, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was connected with that paper sack he had
with him. He brought a bear skin rug from home.
Red figured he&rsquo;d slip away from camp, put it on,
and then sneak back to scare the Cubs. You know&mdash;pretend
to be a real bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red should have known better than to try such
a kid trick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was my fault,&rdquo; Brad said, taking the blame.
&ldquo;I should have set my foot down hard when he
told me his plan. He was so hepped up about it, I
let him go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why didn&rsquo;t he come back as he planned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what has me bothered,&rdquo; Brad admitted
anxiously. &ldquo;He intended to make a few scratching
sounds in the trees and show himself about the
time the story telling reached a climax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red is such a youngster,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway murmured.
&ldquo;He never did have much sense of direction&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now, he may be wandering around in
the woods, hopelessly lost,&rdquo; added Mr. Hatfield
grimly. &ldquo;We must find him quickly, or it may turn
into an all-night job!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER 2</span>
<br />THE FACE ON THE CLIFF</h2>
<p>The Cubs bunched together, waiting for orders.
Red&rsquo;s plight, they knew, easily might be a serious
one. If he foolishly had wandered deep into the
woods, it might be necessary to organize searching
parties in order to find him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway, Dan, Brad and I will try to pick
up his trail,&rdquo; the cubmaster said quietly. &ldquo;The rest
of you go to the house and wait there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad followed Mr. Holloway and the
cubmaster to the fringe of woods, leaving the other
Cubs to make their way up the hill. Mr. Hatfield
took an optimistic view of the disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red has good sense,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Furthermore,
unless he&rsquo;s forgotten Cub training, he&rsquo;ll eventually
find his way back to camp or to the road. The
worst is, if he doesn&rsquo;t show up shortly, his parents
will be scared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>Ahead, the cool forest loomed dark and rather
terrifying. By day, the trails wound pleasantly
through the preserve, skirting ravines and crossing
rustic bridges. But now, the entire area had a forbidding
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all must stay close together,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
instructed. &ldquo;Now Dan, show us where it was that
you last saw Red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan already had identified the spot, a narrow
gap through two tall birch trees. He had noted
the place, for the white trunks had stood out distinctly
in the starlight.</p>
<p>After he had pointed it out, Mr. Hatfield went
ahead, flashing the bright beam of his flashlight
on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red came this way, all right,&rdquo; he declared,
elated at having picked up the trail so easily. &ldquo;See!
Here&rsquo;s a deep heel mark in the mud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could have induced him to wander off?&rdquo;
Mr. Holloway speculated. &ldquo;I thought Red knew
better. He evidently had no intention of gathering
wood because he passed up plenty of it at the edge
of the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dark forest, it became increasingly difficult
to follow Red&rsquo;s trail. After moving deeper into the
trees, the party halted to listen for a moment and
then to shout Red&rsquo;s name.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s wandered a long distance away, that&rsquo;s
sure,&rdquo; the cubmaster said. &ldquo;Perhaps to the ravine.
Our voices might not carry to him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why would Red go that far?&rdquo; Brad asked
himself aloud. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it. He only intended
to play a little joke on the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, in advance of the others, halted
so abruptly that Brad bumped into him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, here&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; the cubmaster exclaimed.</p>
<p>He stooped to pick up a paper sack lying in
plain view on a log.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one Red had!&rdquo; Brad cried, instantly
recognizing it.</p>
<p>Inside the sack, Mr. Hatfield found a neatly
folded bearskin rug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red intended to play a joke on the Cubs all
right,&rdquo; he commented. &ldquo;But something caused him
to change his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some reason he decided to go deeper into
the woods,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway added thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Evidently, he wanted to travel fast, so he pitched
this bulky sack. He left it on the log, where he
could find it easily on his way back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>More than ever mystified by the boy&rsquo;s strange
disappearance, the four now hastened on. Soon
however, Mr. Hatfield reported that he no longer
could find any shoeprints on the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red must have turned off somewhere,&rdquo; he told
the others. &ldquo;That will make it a lot harder to find
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four paused, discouraged by the realization
that it might take hours to learn what had become
of the missing boy. A cool wind whispered through
the pines, causing Dan to pull his sweater more
tightly about him. Red, he recalled, had worn no
jacket. Unless they found him soon, he might actually
suffer from cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Brad suddenly. &ldquo;I thought
I heard something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four stood perfectly still, listening. Overhead
an owl hooted, but there was no other unusual
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was certain I heard something,&rdquo; Brad muttered,
ashamed to have aroused false hope. &ldquo;It
sounded like someone running. Guess I imagined
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go back a ways and try to pick
up Red&rsquo;s trail again,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;I only
hope my flashlight holds out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>The searchers turned around, but scarcely had
they gone a dozen yards, than Brad exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! I heard it again! Someone <i>is</i> running
through the underbrush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other three had halted to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Brad!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;It must be Red!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their hope revived, the four shouted the missing
boy&rsquo;s name repeatedly. To their intense relief, an
answering shout came from the left of the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Red!&rdquo; cried Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s over by the ravine, just as I thought!&rdquo;
added Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;Keep shouting, so he can
find us. We&rsquo;ll wait here on the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Red struggled through the
bushes and brambles to confront his would-be
rescuers with a sheepish grin.</p>
<p>He was breathing heavily, having hastened as
fast as he could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, were you out looking for me?&rdquo; he asked,
sagging down on a log to rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were we looking for you!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed
furiously. &ldquo;You and your crazy jokes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I intended to come right back&mdash;honest I did.
But gosh, I had the scare of my life! I&rsquo;m still shakey
from the shock of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t meet a live bear?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>Red shook his head and took a deep breath. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
saw a fire through the trees,&rdquo; he informed his
listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire?&rdquo; Mr. Holloway repeated. &ldquo;In the forest?
That could be serious if it spread. So many cabins
and cottages are situated near the park preserve.
Fires aren&rsquo;t permitted at night, and in daytime only
with written permission of the warden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I started off to find out about it,&rdquo;
Red said quickly. &ldquo;I thought if anyone had left a
fire unwatched, the Cubs ought to know about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see the fires?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield cut
in. &ldquo;Near the ravine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but it wasn&rsquo;t unattended. When I got there&mdash;oh,
gee!&mdash;it scared me half out of my wits. I was
afraid to go very close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get to the point, Red,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway urged
impatiently. &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire had been built on a shelf of the ravine.
It was blazing up high against the rocks, making
the whole cliff wall illuminated. A man, who was
wrapped in a blanket, sat there. His back was to
me so I didn&rsquo;t see his face.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s so frightening about that?&rdquo; Brad demanded.
&ldquo;Was that all you saw?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to the important part,&rdquo; Red went
on breathlessly. &ldquo;Near the fire&mdash;on the clay wall&mdash;I
saw another face&mdash;a huge one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you didn&rsquo;t imagine it?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hatfield
dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was real as anything,&rdquo; Red insisted. &ldquo;The
face was as big as a house and it sort of leered
out at me. Oh, it was weird with the firelight throwing
crazy shadows over the cliff wall! I took one
look and beat it back here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dreamed all that up!&rdquo; Brad accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not!&rdquo; Red denied furiously. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you
if you want me to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late now,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;The Cubs are
waiting at the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to prove that I&rsquo;m right. Honest, I didn&rsquo;t
imagine it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can show us the face tomorrow&mdash;by daylight,&rdquo;
the cubmaster replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it may be gone then.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It will be all right,&rdquo; scoffed Brad. &ldquo;And that
man you saw by the fire too! I&rsquo;ve explored every
trail in the metropolitan park and never came upon
any giants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The face didn&rsquo;t look human,&rdquo; Red described
it nervously. &ldquo;It sort of loomed out of the wall&mdash;huge
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As large as saucers?&rdquo; teased Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they were, and you needn&rsquo;t rub it in! I saw
the face, and I&rsquo;m willing to prove it if anyone will
give me a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have your chance tomorrow,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
soothed him. &ldquo;Odd though, about that fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seriously doubt the warden would grant anyone
a permit in this section of the park,&rdquo; added
Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;The danger of starting a forest
fire is great at this time of year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Red insisted that his attention first
had been attracted by a glimpse of a camp fire
through the trees, the others could not now see
the blaze. Despite the boy&rsquo;s insistence that the
sight he had viewed was very real, they were inclined
to think his eyes had played him false.</p>
<p>Decidedly crestfallen, Red accompanied his
would-be rescuers back to the Holloway cottage.
Immediately, the other Cubs fell upon him, demanding
to know where he had been so long.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Brad and Dan would have spared their chum the
tale, but Red himself told it. In fact, he expanded
upon his original story, building up the face he had
seen as an awe-inspiring apparition.</p>
<p>At first the Cubs were impressed, but as Red
added more and more to the tale, they began to
scoff. Soon they flatly informed him that he was
&ldquo;talking through his hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were scared, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo; accused Midge.
&ldquo;You thought you&rsquo;d play a joke on us with that
bear skin. Instead, the joke&rsquo;s on you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Red got out there in the woods and began
seeing things that weren&rsquo;t so,&rdquo; chuckled Mack.</p>
<p>The teasing so upset Red that he spilled a little
of the hot chocolate in the mug Mrs. Holloway had
served him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; he retorted fiercely. &ldquo;Just give
me a chance! That&rsquo;s all I ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs, one and all, grinned provokingly. Red
subsided into hurt silence.</p>
<p>Then unexpectedly, Mrs. Holloway, the Den
Mother, sided with Red. As she passed a plate of
chicken sandwiches, she remarked quietly;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About a half hour ago, while I was working in
the kitchen, I noticed a light somewhere back in
the woods. It looked for all the world like a bonfire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire!&rdquo; cried Red triumphantly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d I tell
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It struck me as very strange,&rdquo; continued Mrs.
Holloway. &ldquo;With so many cottages nearby, a fire
in the park could be serious unless carefully tended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think Red may not have imagined
that face on the cliff?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Hatfield
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering if an investigation might not
be advisable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Holloway&rsquo;s observation was sufficient to
completely change the attitude of the Cubs. Instead
of making fun of Red, they now began to ask Mr.
Hatfield when they could visit the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; he promised as the meeting broke
up. &ldquo;If anyone is camping in the woods without
permission, we ought to find out about it. We&rsquo;ll
gather here after school for canoe practice and a
little trip of exploration. Who knows, we may run
into something interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER 3</span>
<br />RED PROVES HIS POINT</h2>
<p>The next night after school, all the Cubs except
Mack, who had a paper route, gathered at the
Holloway beach for canoe practice.</p>
<p>Dan, Brad, Chips and Fred had passed their
swimming tests with flying colors. Red, less skillful
at water sports, was assigned to painting
paddles.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield provided him with a number of
interesting Navajo designs, telling him to make his
own selection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do a good job of painting, Red, we&rsquo;ll
exhibit your paddle at the Indian pow-wow,&rdquo; he
promised. &ldquo;An award is to be made to the Den that
turns in the most artistic one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come up with a prize winner!&rdquo; Red grinned.
A talented art student in the Webster City elementary
school, he was confident of his ability. &ldquo;Right
now, though, I&rsquo;ve got other things on my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Weird faces on the cliff?&rdquo; the cubmaster
prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My honor&rsquo;s at stake,&rdquo; Red declared. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll
just give me a chance to prove&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; promised Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;First,
canoe practice, and then we&rsquo;ll hike to the ravine to
satisfy our curiosity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Red busied himself on the beach, painting
paddles, the other Cubs, took turns using the canoe
Mr. Halloway had provided for their use. Brad and
Dan already had mastered the knack of guiding the
craft skillfully and were developing strong arm
muscles.</p>
<p>After a hard paddle against the current, the two
Cubs returned to shore to give up their places to
Chips and Fred.</p>
<p>As they stepped out on the sand, they saw a
newcomer talking to Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s Ross Langdon!&rdquo; Dan muttered
under his breath. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scouting for Den 1, I&rsquo;ll bet a cent,&rdquo; Brad replied.
&ldquo;You know Ross! He&rsquo;s already afraid we&rsquo;ll
get ahead of him somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We usually do, too,&rdquo; grinned Dan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Ross and Dan long had been friendly rivals.
Both were excellent swimmers, though in a Pack
competition, Dan had proven himself to be the
better. Ross, who prided himself upon excelling in
all sports, never had forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s here to see how we&rsquo;re getting along in
canoe practice,&rdquo; Dan remarked. &ldquo;Well, I hope he
gets an eye full!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross was tall and gangling, having grown so fast
that his Cub uniform already was too small for
him. He was strong for his age, inclined to be arrogant,
and was the least liked of any boy in Den 1.</p>
<p>Aware that Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway were
within hearing distance, Ross addressed the two
Cubs respectfully enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working hard, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just practicing a little,&rdquo; Dan answered carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should,&rdquo; Ross retorted boastfully. &ldquo;Den 1 is
all set to take you for a cleaning in the canoe race.
We&rsquo;ll win in a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the Den 1 boy had hoped to get a retort from
Brad or Dan, they disappointed him by remaining
silent. Irked by his failure to start a spirited debate,
Ross picked up the paddle upon which Red
had been working.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, be careful!&rdquo; Red protested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make
the paint run!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t make it look much worse than it is,&rdquo;
Ross said contemptuously. &ldquo;You should see some
of the paddles Den 1 has painted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Works of art, I suppose?&rdquo; Brad asked dryly.
&ldquo;Going to exhibit &rsquo;em at the museum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, after we&rsquo;ve nailed first prize at the Pack
exhibition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put that paddle down before you wreck it!&rdquo;
Red ordered furiously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting sand on the
fresh paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me.&rdquo; With an elaborate bow, Ross laid
the paddle on the sand near the river&rsquo;s edge.
Glancing around, he next demanded: &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
your hogan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t started it yet,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
probably get it up over the week-end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Den 1 has a dandy all finished,&rdquo; Ross continued
boastfully. &ldquo;We put it up in nothing flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan could not resist saying cuttingly: &ldquo;It probably
looks like it too! We aim to take our time and
do a good job.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>Ignoring the jibe, Ross glowingly described the
accomplishments of the Den 1 Cubs. Not only had
they completed a Navajo hogan, but they likewise
had started to build a trading post and a Wells
Fargo station, he informed his listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re building a loom too, for blanket weaving,&rdquo;
he went on grandly. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve already
gathered six boxes of clothing to send out West to
the Navajo reservation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re ahead of us all right,&rdquo; Dan conceded.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve only started on the program. You&rsquo;ll see
us put on steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so. Otherwise, Den 1 will have absolutely
no competition at the pow-wow.&rdquo; Affecting
a bored air, Ross sauntered away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That snoop!&rdquo; Red snorted. &ldquo;He came here to
spy and for no other reason. I don&rsquo;t believe half
what he said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably true Den 1 is ahead of us, but that
doesn&rsquo;t mean it will be that way in another week,&rdquo;
Dan declared. &ldquo;They started in before we did, so
naturally we&rsquo;re behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red, who a few minutes before, had been very
proud of the Indian design he had painted on the
paddle, gazed at it with distaste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it isn&rsquo;t much of a job,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a swell design!&rdquo; Brad reassured him. &ldquo;Not
that you won&rsquo;t be able to do even better with a
little more practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll work on an original design&mdash;not one copied
from a book!&rdquo; Red announced grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show that
Ross Langdon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit,&rdquo; laughed Brad. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s
a good thing he came prowling around here. It will
spur us to greater effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Ross had gone, the Cubs kept on with their
canoe practice until long shadows began to finger
out across the water. Mr. Hatfield then called a
halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we want to hike to
the ravine, we&rsquo;ll have to make a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Chips pulled the canoe out of the
water, taking care to drag it far up on shore beyond
the reach of waves. There they overturned it so
that it would be dry when they wanted to use it
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let Red lead the way,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said
as the boys started off through the woods. &ldquo;Think
you can find the ravine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can, Mr. Hatfield. And I&rsquo;ll prove&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we know,&rdquo; cut in Chips wearily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
believe you when we see it. Just lead the way and
don&rsquo;t give with so many promises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goaded by the knowledge that his fellow Cubs
still believed his report of the previous night to be
a brain fantasy, Red started doggedly off through
the woods.</p>
<p>At first he followed the well-marked trail. After
going a short distance, he hesitated briefly and
then moved off in a diagonal direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything looks different in the daytime,&rdquo; he
complained. &ldquo;I think I came this way, but I&rsquo;m
not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give up already?&rdquo; Fred teased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ravine is just ahead,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;It
extends for the entire distance of the park preserve
though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently, the Cubs emerged from the trees to
find themselves on a great limestone rock overlooking
a deep gash in the earth.</p>
<p>In either direction, as far as they could see,
stretched the shadowy ravine. At the bottom, a
tiny stream of clear water rippled and foamed over
the rocks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>Opposite the Cubs, the cliff walls rose somber
but entirely blank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your big face, Red?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have come out at the wrong place,&rdquo; Red
mumbled. &ldquo;It should be here, or somewhere close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even a trace of a bon-fire,&rdquo; remarked Chips.
&ldquo;I guess this proves who was right, Red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him a chance, boys,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;The place Red&rsquo;s looking for may be up the
ravine from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Red agreed quickly. &ldquo;This doesn&rsquo;t
look like the place at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, lead us to it then,&rdquo; urged Fred. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
all we&rsquo;re waiting for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considerably let-down, Red turned to the left,
picking his way along the edge of the ravine. At
intervals, he paused to scan the walls and shelf of
rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, my feet hurt!&rdquo; Chips presently complained.
&ldquo;How much farther do we walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red halted, gazing at Mr. Hatfield in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, I guess. I never came this far last
night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we&rsquo;ll have to give up the search for
this afternoon,&rdquo; the cubmaster said regretfully.
&ldquo;We can try again sometime, Red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub made no reply, but was sunk in gloom.
Well he knew that the other boys would make life
miserable for him, twitting him about his vivid
imagination.</p>
<p>He was grateful that during the hike back along
the ravine, they refrained from making remarks.</p>
<p>Reaching the turn-off by the granite boulder,
Red again paused to survey the site.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we went the wrong direction,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;If we&rsquo;d turned right instead of left, we&rsquo;d have hit
the place. Close by too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No alibis,&rdquo; chided Chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just give me five minutes more,&rdquo; the boy pleaded.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I ask. Five minutes! If I can&rsquo;t find
the place by that time, then I&rsquo;m willing to eat
worms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five minutes?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Hatfield, noting
how rapidly darkness was falling upon the ravine.
&ldquo;I guess we can give you that much time, but no
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, then,&rdquo; Red urged, leading off, almost
at a dog trot. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re traveling fast this time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>The Cubs were hard pressed to keep up. Sure of
foot, Red skirted close to the edge of the steep
cliffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the right way, I&rsquo;m certain!&rdquo; he encouraged
the others. &ldquo;I think I remember that white
birch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think!&rdquo; Chips exploded as he caught his
shoe on a sharp rock. &ldquo;You better be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abruptly, Red halted. So suddenly did he stop
that those behind him bumped into one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you!&rdquo; he fairly shouted. &ldquo;I guess
this proves whether or not I was dreaming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through a gap in the bushes, the Cubs glimpsed
the opposite wall of the ravine. One section of it
had fallen away, leaving an expanse of rich clay.</p>
<p>From this surface loomed a grotesque carved
face, that of a man with very severe features.</p>
<p>The Cubs were so taken aback that for a full
minute they could only stand and stare. Then Dan
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s real enough. Gosh, what a face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it get here?&rdquo; Brad demanded. &ldquo;Who
carved it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about that fire Red saw?&rdquo; added
Chips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can see where a fire was built on that rock
shelf directly below the carved face,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Hatfield.</p>
<p>Both he and Mr. Holloway were mystified by
the strange carving, having had no knowledge that
anything of the sort could be found in the park
area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone was here last night all right,&rdquo; the cubmaster
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And someone&rsquo;s here now,&rdquo; murmured Brad,
peering intently down into a clump of bushes
directly behind the dead ashes of the camp fire.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re being watched by a man who&rsquo;s hiding there
in the foliage!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER 4</span>
<br />SUSPICION</h2>
<p>Brad&rsquo;s observation caused the other Cubs to
glance alertly toward the clump of bushes. Distinctly,
they could see a crouching figure among
the leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone is hiding there!&rdquo; cried Red.</p>
<p>His words carried across the chasm and to the
man who squatted close against the wall of the
cliff.</p>
<p>As the Cubs watched, the bush moved convulsively.
They saw the shadowy figure retreat behind
the screen of foliage, and finally disappear on a
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scared him away, Red!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.
&ldquo;Who was he, anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the person who carved that grotesque
face in the clay wall,&rdquo; commented Brad. &ldquo;Whoever
he was, he didn&rsquo;t want us to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go after him,&rdquo; urged Chips, eager for
action. &ldquo;How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>To reach the opposite side of the chasm, it
would be necessary to make a sharp descent, and
an equally sharp climb on the other side. By the
time the Cubs could reach the site of the carved
clay face, the fleeing man would be far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use going after him,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield decided.
&ldquo;After all, he may have as much right to be in this
park area as we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he was the one who carved that
queer face?&rdquo; speculated Fred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very likely,&rdquo; agreed his father. &ldquo;The face
isn&rsquo;t quite finished. Notice the left side. The cheek
is only half carved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs stood for several minutes, gazing at
the huge face which seemed to return their stare.
A lowering sun cast a reddish-golden glow over the
upper section while the remainder of the carving
was shrouded in cool shadow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever did the work is a skilled sculptor,&rdquo;
commented Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible that the
park authorities authorized someone to make the
carving.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But why in clay?&rdquo; pointed out Brad. &ldquo;A few
heavy rains will destroy the work. To be of permanent
value, it would have to be carved in the rock
face of the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this part of the park seldom is visited,&rdquo;
contributed Midge. &ldquo;If the park authorities ordered
the work, wouldn&rsquo;t they want it done where visitors
could see it easily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield acknowledged the logic of the
Cubs&rsquo; deductions. He readily agreed that the carving
might have been done by a crank, a man with
a peculiar twist of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very talented individual, however,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in Webster City would have the skill to
make such a carving?&rdquo; speculated Mack. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know of anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further study of the unusual carving, convinced
the Cubs that it was intended to be the face of an
Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had that old boy for our pow-wow!&rdquo;
chuckled Dan. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d certainly out-class Den 1.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rather elated by their discovery of the carved
face, the Cubs lingered for awhile. Then, as the
hour grew late, they started back to the beach at
a brisk pace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I guess now you&rsquo;ll quit twitting me about my
vivid imagination,&rdquo; Red said, enjoying his victory.
&ldquo;Who was right after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were,&rdquo; Brad told him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send you a
letter of apology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; laughed Red. &ldquo;Just treat me
with more respect in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon reaching the beach site, the boys began
to gather up their belongings, preparatory to starting
to their separate homes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to get ahead of Den 1 in the
Indian handicraft exhibit, we&rsquo;ll have to meet here
almost every night after school for a week or two,&rdquo;
Dan informed his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; echoed Brad. &ldquo;You heard Ross
boasting that the Den 1 Cubs have their Navajo
hogan already up. We&rsquo;ve not even started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get going on that tomorrow night,&rdquo;
Chips declared. &ldquo;How about a trading post or a
Wells Fargo station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can make &rsquo;em if the fellows want to,&rdquo; Brad
agreed. &ldquo;Just to be different though, why not try
a big sand painting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Chips, whose knowledge
of Indian tradition and ceremony was limited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dan will tell you,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been reading
up about it at the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Urged to share his information, Dan began by
explaining that the art of making sand paintings
had been adopted from the Pueblo Indians and
made into a high art by the Navajos.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty years ago, few persons were allowed
to witness the making of a sand painting,&rdquo; he told
the Cubs. &ldquo;Even today, the Indians seldom allow
anyone to sketch the pictures or take photographs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how are we going to make one?&rdquo; Midge
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the ordinary designs and patterns are available.
I was just giving you the background. Among
the Navajos, sand painting is a sacred ceremony,
held in connection with healing of the sick or initiation
of a member into the tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most sand paintings are started at daybreak,
aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; prompted Brad.</p>
<p>Dan nodded, warming to his subject. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so
they&rsquo;ll be completed before sunset. It&rsquo;s supposed to
bring bad luck, if a painting isn&rsquo;t done in one day.
Several persons work on the larger pictures, but a
medicine man or high priest always is in charge of
the work.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>Fred asked what type of scenes were used in the
paintings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No two are alike,&rdquo; Dan explained. &ldquo;The designs
are all abstract, symbolic in meaning. Colored
sand is used, of course. Each color has a special
significance. For instance, browns and grays are for
fulfillment. White represents the morning. Blue is
for goodness or happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sounds too hard,&rdquo; complained Mack.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we make something easy like a house or a
sunset?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be according to the Navajo tradition.
I&rsquo;m in favor of trying to do it right or not at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; chimed in Red. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stick to the
Cub motto: &lsquo;Do Your Best.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for that,&rdquo; Mack agreed. &ldquo;But how are we
going to get colored sand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; declared Dan.</p>
<p>He told the Cubs they might use powdered
paints, ground-up flower pots for the red color,
table salt for white, and cornmeal for yellow. From
library books he already had compiled several
drawings from which they might make a selection
of design.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you know all about it, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Chips
demanded, admiringly. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s elect him Medicine
Man, fellows. How about putting him in charge of
the sand painting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; agreed Mack and Fred, glad to turn the
responsible assignment over to the capable denner.</p>
<p>All the others likewise voted for Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gather together the stuff we need,&rdquo; he promised.
&ldquo;When it comes to making the painting,
though, I&rsquo;ll need plenty of help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Dan in charge, the other Cubs were confident
that all details of the project would be carried
through with speed and efficiency.</p>
<p>By far Dan was the most popular Cub in Den 2.
Not only was he even-tempered, modest and an
excellent student and athlete, but he had a way of
&ldquo;making things go.&rdquo; The boys never had forgotten
how he had saved the Den&rsquo;s honor when a Webster
City pheasant raiser wrongfully had accused them
of stealing his valuable birds.</p>
<p>The story of the Cubs&rsquo; encounter with the foreman
of the farm and their part in saving his prize
pheasants during a disastrous flood, has been told
in the first volume of this series: &ldquo;Dan Carter, Cub
Scout.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>By placing Dan in charge of the sand painting
project, the boys felt that the job already was half
done.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield now came up to inquire if the Cubs
were ready to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like rain tonight,&rdquo; he remarked, surveying
the darkening sky. &ldquo;So don&rsquo;t leave anything
lying around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that paddle you painted this afternoon?&rdquo;
Brad asked Red. He had noticed that the
boy did not have it with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you pick it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips looked troubled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it lying on
the beach a minute ago,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Anyone else
pick it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Cubs looked blank, shaking their
heads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll flash back there and have another look-see,&rdquo;
Chips offered. &ldquo;Wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone a long while. When finally he rejoined
the group, he was without the paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; he announced, his face grim.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then someone must have picked it up,&rdquo; declared
Dan. &ldquo;Everyone check.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs could not find the missing canoe paddle
among their belongings or anywhere nearby.
Thinking that Mr. Holloway or Mr. Hatfield might
have locked it into the cabin, Brad went there to
look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sign of it,&rdquo; he reported. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a cent that
paddle is still on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look then,&rdquo; Chips challenged. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
find it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs dropped their knapsacks and trooped
down to the beach. Chips&rsquo; footprints plainly were
visible in the sand, showing where he had wandered
in his fruitless search.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See any paddle?&rdquo; the boy demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you certain you left it here, Red?&rdquo; Dan inquired
dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I&rsquo;m certain! Right here by the river.
I wanted it to dry so I left it turned up to the sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it couldn&rsquo;t have paddled itself away!&rdquo;
Chips wisecracked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very funny!&rdquo; Red glared at him. &ldquo;I spent a
long while painting that paddle. Now it&rsquo;s gone.
Either one of you took it for a joke or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;On your honor, fellows, has anyone seen Red&rsquo;s
paddle?&rdquo; Brad soberly questioned the group.</p>
<p>All the Cubs reasserted that they had not touched
the missing item.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When last I saw it, Red was laying it out in the
sun just as he said,&rdquo; added Midge. &ldquo;Maybe it floated
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like fun!&rdquo; Chips snorted. &ldquo;This river doesn&rsquo;t
have a tide. I know what became of that paddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross Langdon took it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment after Chips had made his accusation,
no one spoke.</p>
<p>Then Mack said thoughtfully: &ldquo;He was around
here making remarks. He looked at the paddle
several times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came here to snoop!&rdquo; Chips accused angrily.
&ldquo;He was afraid Red&rsquo;s paddle would win a prize in
the handicraft contest, so either he took it for meanness
or he pitched it into the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross didn&rsquo;t have anything in his hands when
he left here,&rdquo; Dan said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he shoved it into the river and it floated
away! That&rsquo;s probably what it did!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chips, don&rsquo;t go completely off your base,&rdquo; Brad
interposed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re making some pretty rash accusations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross likes to win,&rdquo; added Dan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s boastful
too. But I&rsquo;d hate to think he&rsquo;s dishonest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Cub never should make that accusation
against another unless he&rsquo;s prepared to back it up
with proof,&rdquo; resumed Brad severely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re only
making wild guesses, Chips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if Ross didn&rsquo;t take the paddle, who did?
Answer me that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what became of the paddle, Chips.
Red was rather careless though, to leave it lying so
close to the river&rsquo;s edge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, so it&rsquo;s all my fault?&rdquo; cried Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t get huffy. No one is blaming you.
On the other hand, we&rsquo;ve no right to put it on
Ross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wait until I see that lad,&rdquo; Chips muttered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drag it out of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad took Chips by the arm, giving him a little,
impatient shake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get hold of yourself,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;Do you
want to stir up bad feeling between Den 1 and Den
2? If you go to Ross and accuse him, you&rsquo;ll get all
of his denmates sore at us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our Indian pow-wow will turn into full scale
war instead of a nice friendly competition,&rdquo; warned
Dan severely. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do it, Chips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; the boy growled. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
going to make such a fuss about it, I&rsquo;ll keep quiet.
I&rsquo;m convinced though, that Ross got away with that
paddle! I&rsquo;ll keep on thinking so too, unless it shows
up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER 5</span>
<br />STRANGE INDIANS</h2>
<p>After school for the next three days, the Cub
Scouts spent much of their spare time either at the
river or gathering clothing to be shipped to the
Navajo reservation.</p>
<p>No more was said about the missing paddle.
Though the Den 2 boys saw Ross Langdon in
school, they avoided mention of their loss.</p>
<p>Red meanwhile, obtained another paddle, and
went quietly to work on a more elaborate design.
The finished job was so much better than the first
that all the Cubs declared the Den might actually
have been the gainer for having lost the paddle.</p>
<p>Not to be bested by Den 1, the boys set as one
of their major projects, the making of an Indian
hogan.</p>
<p>The house, they decided, would be made of best
tree boughs and covered over with mud and clay.
Brad pointed out that while it would be easier to
use canvas or cloth for the slanting walls, the mud
would be more in keeping with Navajo tradition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>Hogans were circular, six or eight-sided huts,
with a roof-hole for the escape of smoke, he explained.
The structure had only a single door which
traditionally faced east toward the rising sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The north side of the hogan always is the
&lsquo;woman&rsquo;s side&rsquo; of the house,&rdquo; Brad went on with a
grin. &ldquo;In our hut, we&rsquo;ll skip that. We want it to
look like a real Navajo hogan though. So we&rsquo;ll need
a lot of clay. When it hardens on the skeleton-pole
structure, it should form a hard, rain-proof surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can get plenty of good clay over the cliff,&rdquo;
Dan suggested. &ldquo;I noticed the quality was especially
good there at the ravine near the carved
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grab buckets, fellows, and let&rsquo;s go after it,&rdquo; Brad urged.</p>
<p>Sure of the route, he led the Cubs through the
tall hardwoods toward the ravine. A saucy bird
trilled at them from a tall pine. Otherwise, except
for the chattering of a squirrel, the forest was very
quiet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Well aware that the other Cubs shared his eagerness
to view the carved clay face once more, the
Den Chief hiked directly to the ravine.</p>
<p>The air felt cool and damp as they emerged from
the woods, directly opposite the great carved face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, it&rsquo;s still here!&rdquo; exclaimed Chips. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d half
convinced myself it was all a pipe dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The carving is real enough,&rdquo; declared Dan in
awe.</p>
<p>Even more than upon their previous visit, the
Cubs were impressed by the lifelike appearance of
the staring face.</p>
<p>As they gazed fixed at it, Midge inquired if the
park authorities had been informed of the Cubs&rsquo;
discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield talked to the park superintendent
about it,&rdquo; Dan told the group. &ldquo;It was all news to
Mr. Jennings. He said it must be the work of a
crank. Park employees have been instructed to try
to catch the sculptor, but they haven&rsquo;t time to keep
watch constantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Work has been done since we were here last,&rdquo;
observed Brad. He had been studying the face intently.
&ldquo;See! That section to the left has been
finished.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Red. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny the park
people can&rsquo;t catch the fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not too disturbed about it,&rdquo; Brad replied
carelessly. &ldquo;After all, the carving is a credit
to the park. Mr. Hatfield says it&rsquo;s certainly being
done by a skilled and talented sculptor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t have any idea who the person may
be?&rdquo; Dan questioned thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest. In fact, Webster City has
only one really talented sculptor, and he&rsquo;s so far up
in years, it&rsquo;s unlikely he&rsquo;d attempt anything like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After gazing at the clay image for awhile, the
Cubs descended the sharp incline and struggled up
the steep, uneven slope on the opposite side of the
ravine.</p>
<p>Catching their breath, they viewed the strange
face at close range. Lips and cheeks of the weird
creature had been colored with powdered red sandstone.
Bits of broken dishes formed the whites of
the eyes.</p>
<p>To the left of the face, on the rock shelf lay a
grotesque fallen tree trunk, its dead fingers of roots
stretching out toward the carving. It was at the
base of this tree that the Cubs found the dead
ashes of a fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! It gives me the creeps just looking at that
face!&rdquo; Fred muttered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get our clay and beat
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys began to fill their pails. Now and then
as they worked, they kept casting furtive glances at
the face on the wall. A grim, half-smile played over
the stoical features, as if the carved man were enjoying
his own little joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose that bird keeps himself?&rdquo;
Mack demanded suddenly. &ldquo;The one who
does the carving, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may hide in the forest here,&rdquo; Brad replied.
&ldquo;Whoever he is, the park officials will catch up with
him in time. They&rsquo;re just too busy to spend much
time watching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan straightened suddenly. His attention had
been seized by a faint rustling sound and a slight
movement of bushes to the right of the clay face.</p>
<p>He stood tense on the rock shelf, convinced that
someone was watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Dan?&rdquo; Brad asked, instantly
alert. &ldquo;See anyone?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Indians maybe?&rdquo; teased Red.</p>
<p>The snicker died on his lips and his blood fairly
congealed as two men silently stepped from behind
the foliage. Both wore corduroy pants, rough looking
shirts, boots and sombrero-type hats.</p>
<p>However, the gaunt faces with skin pulled tightly
over cheek bones, plainly distinguished them as
Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jeepers creepers!&rdquo; Chips muttered and sucked
in his breath.</p>
<p>The Cubs instinctively clustered together. Although
the sudden appearance of the two strangers
did not frighten them, they were made vaguely
uneasy.</p>
<p>The taller of the two Indians wore a bracelet
decorated with silver and turquoise. An ornamental
belt girded his lean waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said Brad. He spoke evenly
enough though inwardly he was quaking a bit.
&ldquo;Anything we can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian replied with a guttural rumble in his
throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No speakum English,&rdquo; murmured Red, with a
wink at Fred.</p>
<p>The Indian froze him with a quick glance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Speakum English very well,&rdquo; he replied sarcastically.
&ldquo;I graduated from the University of New
Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Red, taken aback. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry. I
thought from your clothes&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Red,&rdquo; Brad came to his rescue. He
spoke politely to the two Indians. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a Den of
Cub Scouts, out for a hike. This carved face interests
us. You made it perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Indian shook his head. &ldquo;I am Eagle Feather,&rdquo;
he introduced himself. &ldquo;This is White Nose. We
are of the People.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means you&rsquo;re Navajos, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; asked
Dan, who had been reading up on customs of the
reservation Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We come from New Mexico,&rdquo; Eagle Feather
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We search for one of our brothers,&rdquo; added the
other Indian. White Nose also spoke excellent English,
though with less ease.</p>
<p>His raven-hued hair was combed back straight
and long. In the lobe of his left ear hung a single
turquoise earring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scurrilous prairie dog!&rdquo; muttered Eagle
Feather.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see him, perhaps?&rdquo; White Nose questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No prairie dogs,&rdquo; answered Brad. &ldquo;In fact, this
is all Greek to us. We don&rsquo;t know who you&rsquo;re talking
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I bet this is all a joke!&rdquo; exclaimed Mack.
&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield has planned this whole thing to point
up our Navajo pow-wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Midge gave him a quick kick in the shins. The
grim expressions of the two Indians had convinced
him that their appearance had not been planned
by either Mr. Hatfield or Mr. Holloway.</p>
<p>The two Indians had turned to regard intently
the weird carving on the cliff wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We search,&rdquo; said Eagle Feather, &ldquo;for the one
who made that face in the clay. I called him
brother, but he no longer is of the tribe. He is an
outcast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dishonored,&rdquo; added White Nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be punished for his sin against the
tribe,&rdquo; went on Eagle Feather. &ldquo;You have seen him
here at the cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about,&rdquo;
Brad declared uneasily. &ldquo;We came upon this carved
face only a few days ago. We don&rsquo;t know anything
about it, and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this tribesman done that you&rsquo;re so anxious
to find him?&rdquo; Dan asked curiously.</p>
<p>The two Indians, however, did not reply to the
question.</p>
<p>Apparently satisfied that the Cubs could provide
them with no information, they spoke together for
a moment in their own tongue.</p>
<p>Then, with polite farewells, they vanished back
into the trees.</p>
<p>For a long while after the Indians had gone, the
Cubs remained speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it happen? Or did we dream it?&rdquo; Mack
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t dream it,&rdquo; replied Brad soberly. &ldquo;I
almost wish we had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those guys are tough,&rdquo; said Dan. &ldquo;Did you
notice the expression of their faces? Whoever that
Indian is that they&rsquo;re after, I feel sorry for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have violated some law of the tribe,&rdquo;
Chips speculated. &ldquo;Gosh! This is going to be exciting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a lot more than that,&rdquo; declared Brad.
The Cubs saw that he was deeply worried. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
like it a bit&mdash;not a bit. Grab your clay fast, and let&rsquo;s
get out of here. I want to talk to Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER 6</span>
<br />ANOTHER LOSS</h2>
<p>The meeting with the two Indians had excited all
the Cubs and as they hiked back to the day camp,
they could discuss no other subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice Eagle Feather&rsquo;s belt?&rdquo; Dan
asked the others. &ldquo;It had big discs of silver strung
together on leather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seeing it gave me an idea,&rdquo; declared Brad enthusiastically.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll want to make some fancy
Indian costumes for our pow-wow. We can rig up
calico shirts and slit denim trousers up the side.
But we&rsquo;ll need belts to set off the outfits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you can wheedle one from the Indians,&rdquo;
Red twitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a better idea. We&rsquo;ll make em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know anyone that owns a silver mine?&rdquo; Midge
scoffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but the tops of peanut butter cans will do
just as well. We can use the metal discs, punch them
with holes and string them on leather straps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s a good idea!&rdquo; Dan approved instantly.
&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t cost us a cent either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what would snap up our pow-wow more
than anything else,&rdquo; declared Fred. &ldquo;A couple of
real Indians!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Nose and Eagle Feather, for instance?&rdquo;
chuckled Chips, stepping over a fallen tree on the
trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll appoint you a committee of one to arrange
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield might do it,&rdquo; interposed Brad,
taking Chips&rsquo; suggestion half seriously. &ldquo;Those Indians
are well educated and they might be willing
to cooperate with the Cub organization. The only
trouble is, we don&rsquo;t know where they&rsquo;re staying in
Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or what brought them here,&rdquo; added Dan soberly.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t like all that talk about searching
for one of their brothers. They were too grim. To
me, it had an ugly sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seemed to think that the person they&rsquo;re
after carved the face on the cliff,&rdquo; remarked Mack.
&ldquo;That deepens the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Professor Sarazen of the Webster City
College art staff could see that carving,&rdquo; Brad said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;If I get a chance, I think I&rsquo;ll drop
around at his place and tell him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den Chief had been swinging along through
the forest at a smooth but fast pace. Now, coming
to a little brook, he paused abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whad&rsquo;you see?&rdquo; demanded Dan, who was directly
behind.</p>
<p>Without answering immediately, the older boy
bent down to examine a crude snare which had
been built across a game run near the stream bank.
&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been hunting for rabbits here!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hunting is illegal in the metropolitan park
preserve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, it is. Notice anything unusual about this
snare!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan nodded. &ldquo;I saw some pictures like it in those
Indian books I read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an Indian snare all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe White Nose and Eagle Feather set it up
here,&rdquo; Fred speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; agreed Brad, his voice trailing off.</p>
<p>He pocketed the snare, and the Cubs went on to
the day camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>So much time had been lost that the boys knew
they would have to work fast to complete their hogan
before dark. During their absence, Mr. Hatfield
and Mr. Holloway had started the frame of
the hut. Bent boughs had been tied firmly together
with leather and cords.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Navajos have eight different types of
houses,&rdquo; the Cub leader informed the boys as they
worked. &ldquo;The dwelling is erected in a single day,
for all the neighbors come in to help. On the reservations,
they&rsquo;re usually made of pinon logs, cedar
bark, an earth roof, and the chinks filled with mud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an hour the Cubs labored, taking satisfaction
in seeing the hogan grow slowly but surely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; Brad declared in satisfaction, as the
square doorway was nailed on, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s finished! I call
it a dandy job too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; demanded a voice from behind him.</p>
<p>Brad whirled to see Ross Langdon standing
there, a grin on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hello, Ross,&rdquo; Brad greeted him, trying to
make his voice cordial. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t hear you come up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>Ross had been studying the hogan, and obviously
was impressed by the work. But he would not say
so. He sauntered over and leaned rather heavily
against the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, Ross!&rdquo; exclaimed Dan, dropping his hammer.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that. You might knock the thing
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I bother?&rdquo; Ross retorted loftily.
&ldquo;A good strong wind will take care of it. Den 1 has
a much better hogan. We really did a job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear it,&rdquo; Dan replied, refusing to take
offense.</p>
<p>Ross&rsquo; unexpected arrival in camp did not please
the other Cubs. Chips, in particular, had not
abandoned his belief that the Den 1 boy had been
responsible for the loss of the painted paddle. He
now eyed him suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brings you here so often, anyhow?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just looking around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on the tip of Chips&rsquo; tongue to accuse
Ross of taking the missing paddle. However, a
warning glance from Brad caused him to lapse into
silence.</p>
<p>Ross moved away from the hogan toward a site
on the beach which Dan painstakingly had cleared
in preparation for making a large sand painting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going up here?&rdquo; the Den 1 boy asked
curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just a surprise feature for the pow-wow,&rdquo;
Dan told him. &ldquo;An added attraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may have a few other surprises to spring
too,&rdquo; hinted Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Real Indian stuff,&rdquo; Red informed him. &ldquo;Maybe
some Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for Ross. &ldquo;Fat chance of digging
up a live Indian in Webster City,&rdquo; he scoffed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just doing a lot of silly talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darkness was settling over the treetops, so Mr.
Hatfield brought the friendly argument to an end
by saying it was time to end the work for that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks a little like rain,&rdquo; he observed, squinting
at the sky. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to take our tools inside tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of the stuff can be loaded into the canoe
and paddled down stream to the cabin,&rdquo; suggested
Mr. Holloway.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan, aided by Fred, quickly gathered
up the more cumbersome items, stowing them in
the craft. Mr. Hatfield supervised the loading.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>He intended to assign Brad and Dan to take the
canoe in, with Mr. Holloway riding along to supervise
the job.</p>
<p>Before he could do so, Ross grabbed up one of
the paddles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me help,&rdquo; he offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;you know?&rdquo; Chips muttered, his
mouth sagging open.</p>
<p>Without waiting for anyone&rsquo;s consent, Ross
stepped into the canoe. He and Mr. Holloway
shoved off and with deft, sure strokes paddled
downstream toward the nearby Holloway cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross certainly turned cooperative fast,&rdquo; Dan
muttered. &ldquo;You could push me over with a hummingbird&rsquo;s
feather!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that boy paddle!&rdquo; murmured Midge in
grudging admiration. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why he grabbed a paddle,&rdquo; Red said contemptuously.
&ldquo;He wanted to show off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll win the canoe race for Den 1,&rdquo; Midge declared
with misgiving.</p>
<p>Dan and Brad watched Ross silently and without
envy. Each summer the Langdon boy spent
several weeks at his parents&rsquo; cottage on Lake Elmo
and quite naturally had acquired a high degree of
skill at all types of water sports.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>The two Den 2 Cubs knew full well that they
would be up against tough competition in the race.
They wanted to win for their organization. Though
they made no comment, both silently determined
to practice harder than ever before in an effort to
at least give Ross a run for his money.</p>
<p>In the next few days, the Cubs spent all their
spare time either working at the camp or otherwise
making preparation for the coming pow-wow.</p>
<p>One night after school, Dan, Brad and Midge
canvassed several neighborhoods in search of items
to be exhibited and also clothing to be sent to the
Navajo reservation.</p>
<p>By design, Brad included the home of Professor
Sarazen as one of their stops. Mrs. Sarazen gave
the boys a bundle of clothing and showed them a
half dozen beautifully woven Navajo blankets which
her husband had acquired on a trip West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to have one of them for your
pow-wow?&rdquo; she inquired. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all very fine
blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! We&rsquo;d sure like to have one, if you aren&rsquo;t
afraid it might be damaged!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed gratefully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve loaned things to the Cubs before,&rdquo; Mrs.
Sarazen said, smiling. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re very dependable,
I&rsquo;ve learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Removing one of the smaller blankets from a
cedar chest, she spread it out on the floor for the
boys to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a ceremonial blanket, often called a
<i>Yeibitchai</i> or a sand-painting rug,&rdquo; she explained.
&ldquo;The first of this type was made in 1910 by Hosteen
Tia, a Navajo medicine-man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do they call it a sand painting rug?&rdquo; Brad
asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each rug is a replica of a sand painting,&rdquo; Mrs.
Sarazen explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe we could make our sand painting
like this blanket!&rdquo; Dan proposed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awfully
complicated design though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is that,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Sarazen. &ldquo;Almost too
intricate, I&rsquo;d judge, for duplication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blanket was largely woven in black and
white. It was characterized by figures representing
twelve rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sarazen told the Cubs that the original sand
painting from which the blanket had been copied
represented a ceremony connected with a snake-bite
cure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take the blanket along now,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;If the
design isn&rsquo;t too intricate, use it for your own sand
painting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Professor Sarazen sauntered in from the
garden. He told the boys more about Navajo blankets,
tribal customs and habits.</p>
<p>In turn, Brad related how the Cubs had come
upon the strange carved face on the cliff wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see that carving for myself!&rdquo; Professor
Sarazen exclaimed. &ldquo;From your description, I doubt
that it was made by any Webster City sculptor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was pleased to have acquired a genuine
Navajo blanket. The next night after school, he and
Brad took it to the river camp to show to the other
Cubs.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield especially, was impressed by the
fine quality of the weaving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is too fine a blanket to keep here until the
pow-wow,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Since Dan is in charge
of the sand painting, why not make him custodian
of the blanket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, I want to take it home with me,&rdquo;
Dan returned promptly. &ldquo;That is, until the day of
the pow-wow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to suggest that, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>Using the blanket&rsquo;s base design, the Cubs made
a rough sketch of the sand painting. Then they
began to block out the main outline on the beach.</p>
<p>They were hard at work when an elderly man
sauntered into camp. Dan instantly recognized him
as Professor Sarazen, and rushed to welcome him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Making good use of that blanket, I see,&rdquo; commented
the teacher.</p>
<p>After admiring the start which the boys had made
on the sand painting, he remarked that he had come,
hoping someone would show him the carving at
the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to guide you to the spot,&rdquo; Dan
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;ll I,&rdquo; chimed in Chips, eager for a little diversion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t mind a little hike myself,&rdquo; added Fred
quickly.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield laughed, remarking that he thought
all the Cubs wanted to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mystery always is more intriguing than work,&rdquo;
he chuckled. &ldquo;But then, we&rsquo;re well along with our
preparations for the big pow-wow. The hogan is
finished, the sand painting started, and we expect
to get at our Wells Fargo station in a couple of
days. Let&rsquo;s all knock off, and go to the cliff.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>The Cubs were hopeful that Professor Sarazen
would be impressed by the great carved face. Nor
were they mistaken.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the ravine, he made a careful inspection
of the work, declaring it to be Indian in
origin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A somewhat crude carving,&rdquo; he told the Cubs,
&ldquo;but the work of a man of great talent. Amazing
that such a face could be created here and no one
have seen the artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Professor Sarazen had studied the face
awhile, viewing it from several angles, the group
returned to the river camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to break up for tonight, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said. &ldquo;See you all tomorrow after school&mdash;same
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the other Cubs gathered up their belongings,
Dan went to the hogan for the Navajo blanket. He
was gone a long while. When he came out of the
hut, he went directly to Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find the blanket Professor Sarazen let us
have,&rdquo; he said nervously. &ldquo;Did you put it anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Dan. I saw you put it inside the hut
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before we all left for the cliff,&rdquo; Dan agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shook his head. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone&mdash;stolen,&rdquo; he said
miserably. &ldquo;It was valuable too. How am I going
to face Professor Sarazen?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER 7</span>
<br />A BRUSH-OFF</h2>
<p>Professor Sarazen had very little to say when
Dan gave him the disheartening information about
the Navajo blanket. His kindly silence, however,
made the Cubs feel all the worse about the loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault,&rdquo; the professor said quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was!&rdquo; Dan insisted. &ldquo;When we borrowed
the blanket, it was understood that we&rsquo;d take good
care of it. We never dreamed anyone would run off
with it in broad daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may show up later,&rdquo; Professor Sarazen said
to encourage him. &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well aware that the Cubs felt very badly, he did
not add that the blanket was one of the most
valuable in his collection.</p>
<p>While Dan talked with Professor Sarazen, Mr.
Hatfield and Brad again searched the hogan where
the blanket had been left.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Something else is gone!&rdquo; the Cub leader
exclaimed, his gaze roving swiftly about the interior
of the hut. &ldquo;I stored a box of tinned food
here, ready for a cook-out later this week. You
didn&rsquo;t move it, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been inside this hogan all day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it went the same way the blanket did,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said grimly. &ldquo;Frankly, Brad, I don&rsquo;t
like the way things are disappearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That paddle too,&rdquo; Brad recalled. &ldquo;The Cubs
still blame Ross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he took it,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said.
&ldquo;Ross isn&rsquo;t a thief. Someone else is prowling around
this camp. We&rsquo;ll have to be very careful about
leaving anything of value lying around, even during
the daytime. Warn the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In inspecting the inside of the hut, the Cub
leader&rsquo;s eye picked up several moccasin prints not
far from the doorway. He stooped to examine them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! Here&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moccasin prints!&rdquo; agreed Brad. &ldquo;Say, do you
suppose those two Indians&mdash;White Nose and Eagle
Feather could have been sneaking around here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a possibility, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t wear moccasins though,&rdquo; the Den
Chief recalled. &ldquo;I noticed that they wore cowboy
type boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These prints definitely were made by an Indian
moccasin. No use saying anything about it to the
other Cubs, Brad. It might make them uneasy. Just
keep your eyes open, and be careful about leaving
things unguarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure will, Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the Cubs left the camp to return home for
supper, Dan was in a very dark mood. Not only
was he discouraged over the loss of the Navajo
blanket, but he wondered how the sand painting
ever could be properly completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Brad sympathized with him. &ldquo;You
were using the design on the blanket for the sand
painting, weren&rsquo;t you? That is tough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a rough sketch of it. But it&rsquo;s not a very
good job. The design is so complicated, I doubt
the Cubs can follow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you take an easier design?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we have the center all done. I guess
it&rsquo;s better to go on, but it&rsquo;s going to be hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to get that blanket back somehow,
Dan. Professor Sarazen didn&rsquo;t say so, but I have a
hunch it&rsquo;s worth a lot of money.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Losing it has taken all the fun out of planning
for the pow-wow. Any idea what became of it,
Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An idea maybe. But nothing we can act on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Cubs had reached Morton and White
St., where they must separate to go to their individual
homes. They paused in front of Grisby&rsquo;s
Grocery Store to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Standing there, Dan chanced to glance through
the big plateglass window where an array of fruit
had been temptingly displayed.</p>
<p>It was not the fruit, however, which held his
attention. Instead, his gaze fastened upon two men
inside the store. They stood at the counter, making
purchases from Mr. Grisby, the owner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friends!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;Looks as if
they&rsquo;re buying camp stuff. At least they&rsquo;re getting
enough to last &rsquo;em awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad turned to stare through the big grocery
store window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Nose and Eagle Feather!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in and talk to them,&rdquo; Dan suggested
impulsively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to&mdash;very much,&rdquo; Brad said, thinking of
the missing Navajo blanket. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to ask them
some questions. It might not be wise though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean, Brad. The same suspicion
is in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t dare accuse them of anything, Dan.
We have no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I realize that. But at least we can talk to
&rsquo;em. We might learn something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could make the excuse of inviting them to
our next Cub Scout meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; Brad instantly approved.
&ldquo;White Nose and Eagle Feather could tell the Cubs
about Indian customs. Let&rsquo;s do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their minds made up, the two boys entered the
grocery store.</p>
<p>The Indians had their backs turned and did not
appear to notice Brad and Dan.</p>
<p>Eagle Feather was completing a grocery purchase.
He had bought bacon, flour, matches and
items one might need if embarking on an extensive
camping trip.</p>
<p>Now that they were in the store, Brad and Dan
hesitated to speak to the two Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>The Cubs were not actually afraid of the strangers,
but their appearance seemed less friendly
than at the meeting by the cliff. Eagle Feather
and White Nose were grimly intent upon their purchases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead,&rdquo; Dan urged Brad in a whisper, giving
him a nudge. &ldquo;Ask &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad moved closer to the counter. Both Indians
now saw the boys, but stared at them without
friendly recognition.</p>
<p>For an instant the boys were taken aback, wondering
if they had made a mistake.</p>
<p>But a second glance reassured them that the
Indians were the same pair they had met at the
cliff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; Brad began politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Yah eh tah</i>!&rdquo; responded Eagle Feather.</p>
<p>Taken aback, because he knew that both Indians
spoke English almost perfectly, Brad momentarily
was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember us,&rdquo; Dan said, coming to the
rescue. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re the Cub Scouts you met at the cliff.
We want you to come to one of our meetings and
talk to the boys about Indian customs. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Indians stared stoically, as if they had
not understood a single word of the request.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>It was Dan&rsquo;s turn to become confused. He could
not comprehend the Indians&rsquo; strange behavior.
Why were they turning on the &ldquo;freeze,&rdquo; pretending
that they never had seen the pair before?</p>
<p>White Nose deliberately turned his back to Brad
and Dan. He directed himself to the storekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Doh quih?</i>&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Then as the storekeeper failed to catch the meaning,
he grudgingly interpreted in English, &ldquo;How
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight dollars and twenty-three cents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>White Nose paid the amount, receiving change
for a ten-dollar bill. He pocketed the money and
picked up the box of groceries. The pair left the
store without a second glance at the two Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, was that a brush-off?&rdquo; Dan demanded indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They knew us all right! For some reason they
pretended otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe they stole the Navajo blanket, and were
afraid we&rsquo;d jump them for it, Brad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what I was thinking,&rdquo; Brad agreed
soberly. &ldquo;Looks as if they&rsquo;re planning on camping
out somewhere in the woods, judging from all the
supplies they bought. If they&rsquo;re going to stay anywhere
near our river place, then it behooves us to
keep watch!&rdquo;</p>

<br />DAN&rsquo;S SAND PAINTING</h2>
<p>After school the next night, all the Cubs took
turns using Mr. Hallowell&rsquo;s canoe and practicing
their strokes.</p>
<p>While Dan, Midge and Chips worked on the sand
painting, the other boys received instructions in
water safety. Because Brad and Dan were the most
proficient with a paddle, their practice session came
last.</p>
<p>The two paddled across the river and back, carefully
timing their strokes. Deep, even thrusts sent
the craft fairly skimming through the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How you coming on the sand painting, Dan?&rdquo;
the older boy asked from the stern seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About two-thirds,&rdquo; Dan replied. He rested a
moment on his paddle, glancing at the overcast sky.
&ldquo;Think it will rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I doubt it at this time of year.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A hard rain could ruin our picture. Mr. Hatfield
is covering it with canvas tonight&mdash;just in case.
The covering will protect it from a light shower.
But if it pours, the canvas probably wouldn&rsquo;t keep
the colors from running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fuss over that sand picture as if it were a
baby, Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want Den 2 to win the pow-wow handicraft
contest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but no use making yourself a nervous
wreck about it. The canoe race is just as important.
Mr. Hatfield told me this afternoon, he&rsquo;s definitely
decided to put you and me in as the contestants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No foolin&rsquo;?&rdquo; At this information, Dan began
stroking faster again. &ldquo;I thought maybe he&rsquo;d select
Midge instead of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge is good,&rdquo; Brad conceded. &ldquo;But you have
a little the edge over him. I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re going to
be my partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan warmed to the praise, for he knew that the
Den Chief always meant his words. The canoe
moved through a patch of water lilies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, wait a second!&rdquo; Dan cried, lifting his paddle.
&ldquo;Mom would like some of those lilies! I want
to get a handful of &rsquo;em for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad obediently backed water, holding the craft
steady in the lily patch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Resting his own paddle across the gunwales,
Dan reached out to seize one of the flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, be careful!&rdquo; Brad warned.</p>
<p>The flower root was long and tough. As Dan
tugged, the canoe rocked dangerously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll upset us!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed. &ldquo;Hey, watch
that paddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The canoe had given a convulsive movement.
Before Dan could snatch the paddle, it slid into
the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it goes!&rdquo; Brad declared in disgust. &ldquo;Of
all the dumb tricks! A fine example we&rsquo;re setting
the other Cubs in water safety. I just hope they
didn&rsquo;t see that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Dan apologized. &ldquo;I know Mr.
Holloway told us never to lay a paddle across the
canoe, but I was in such a hurry to get that water
lily, I forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll lose the paddle, if we don&rsquo;t fish it out of
the river pretty fast. Wow! Look at it travel down
stream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paddle had cleared the lily pads and reeds
and was floating free. Apparently, it was caught in
a fast-moving current, for it traveled down river at
an astonishing rate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>Brad dipped in his paddle, heading the canoe
in pursuit. A few firm strokes brought him alongside.</p>
<p>However, as Dan reached out to scoop in the
runaway, it again moved beyond his grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we are in a fast current!&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>Brad paddled again, and after another miscalculation,
managed to rescue the truant paddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nice exhibition!&rdquo; he grinned. &ldquo;I hope that
teaches me a lesson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad did not chide his friend for carelessness.
In fact, he was thinking more about the current
than he was of the manner in which the paddle
had been lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what causes such a fast movement in
this particular part of the river?&rdquo; he speculated.
&ldquo;It gives me the idea&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>What the idea was, Dan never learned. For just
then, Mr. Hatfield yelled across the water, motioning
for the boys to come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw me drop that paddle all right,&rdquo; Dan
said ruefully.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield did not scold the two boys, merely
reminding them again that safety rules must be
observed at all times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both swimmers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but even so,
you can&rsquo;t afford to take chances. Besides, you must
set examples for the other Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t happen again, Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; Dan
promised. &ldquo;I just had a mental lapse, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader told the boys that the Indian
pow-wow definitely had been set for the following
Saturday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t give us much time,&rdquo; Brad said
anxiously. &ldquo;Think you can get the sand painting
finished in time, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow night probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling that not an hour should be wasted, Dan
called Midge and Chips and the three again went
to work.</p>
<p>On the east side of the picture, Dan made a circle
to represent the sun, filling it in with colored sand.</p>
<p>He was hard at work when Brad called to say
that the other Cubs were hiking to the cliff to see
if any more work had been done on the carved
face.</p>
<p>Chips and Midge, tired of working on the sand
design, quickly joined those who were leaving with
Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, Dan?&rdquo; the Cub leader called to him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, go on without me,&rdquo; Dan answered, absorbed
in the sand painting. &ldquo;I want to get this thing
finished before we leave here tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you don&rsquo;t want to come along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shook his head. Chips and Midge offered
to stay with him, but he told them it wouldn&rsquo;t be
necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can finish it alone,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t
take me much longer now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Left to himself, Dan kept steadily at work. The
picture now had taken on both form and color,
with pleasing symbols in blue, black, yellow and
red.</p>
<p>Carefully, he sifted the sand, trying not to blur
edges of the outlines. Often, however, the capricious
wind would snatch the grains from his fingers,
blowing them helter-skelter.</p>
<p>Dan lost all count of time as he worked. Finally,
the last outline had been filled with yellow sand,
and the job was done.</p>
<p>Tired, but thoroughly pleased, the boy rocked
back on his heels to survey the picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not bad&mdash;not half bad,&rdquo; he remarked aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>Dan suddenly realized that the hour had grown
late, for both the river and the nearby forest were
darkening. The Cubs, he knew, had been gone a
long while. At any moment, they should be returning
to camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be surprised to find the picture finished!&rdquo;
he thought proudly.</p>
<p>Dan stood back to survey the sand picture. The
edges were blowing and he was a little worried lest
the outlines be ruined by the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have Brad help me cover it up with canvas
as soon as he gets back,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Wish he&rsquo;d
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan glanced toward the forest in the direction
the Cubs had gone. None of the boys were in sight.
What was keeping them so long at the ravine?</p>
<p>Deciding to wash his hands, Dan sauntered
down to the river. As he crossed the rippled sand
he was startled to see a moccasin print near the
overturned canoe.</p>
<p>Rather alarmed by the discovery, the boy bent
to examine the print carefully. It was much too
large to have been made by one of the Cubs. At
any rate, they all wore rubber-soled shoes.</p>
<p>Searching near the water&rsquo;s edge close to the
canoe, Dan found other similar moccasin marks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been sneaking around here since Mr.
Hatfield left,&rdquo; he thought uneasily.</p>
<p>More than ever, Dan now wished that the Cubs
would return to camp. Though not afraid to remain
alone, he could not rid himself of an uncomfortable
feeling that at this very moment he was being
watched from the nearby woods.</p>
<p>His mind dwelt upon the unpleasant recollection
that a painted paddle, food and a highly valuable
blanket had disappeared from camp. Now it seemed
someone had designs upon the canoe!</p>
<p>The trail of moccasin prints could not be traced
beyond the beach. Yet Dan was almost certain that
their maker, perhaps one of the Indians he had
met, had taken refuge in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing I can do except warn Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;A nice thing when one can&rsquo;t leave
anything lying around without having it disappear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan went down to the water&rsquo;s edge to wash his
hands. The river looked very dark and menacing,
an indication that a storm might be brewing.</p>
<p>Overhead, black clouds were traveling rapidly
across the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Storm&rsquo;s coming up fast,&rdquo; Dan thought uneasily.
&ldquo;I hope the Cubs get back before it breaks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he straightened up from washing his
hands, a strong breath of air stirred the trees.
Waves began to pile up on the beach.</p>
<p>Fearful that the canoe might be washed away,
Dan pulled it farther back on shore.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, a great gust of wind swept the
beach. Sand was flung in Dan&rsquo;s face, causing him
to cough and choke.</p>
<p>The wind blew hard for a minute or two and
then subsided. A few large drops of rain splashed
down.</p>
<p>Deciding to seek the shelter of the hogan, Dan
scrambled up the slope to the camp.</p>
<p>Pausing an instant to catch his breath, he gazed
down on the cleared square of beach where only a
few minutes before he had completed the sand
painting.</p>
<p>A gasp of dismay escaped his lips. For where the
picture had been, there was now only a hodge-podge
of wildly mixed colors!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER 9</span>
<br />A LOST PADDLE</h2>
<p>A half-sob escaped Dan as he beheld the ruin of
the beautiful sand painting. The work of hours&mdash;completely
destroyed! It was almost too much to
bear.</p>
<p>As he stood staring at the meaningless mess of
mixed color, the boy heard footsteps behind him.
He turned quickly to see that it was Mr. Hatfield
and the Cubs returning from their hike to the ravine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi, Dan!&rdquo; the Cub leader greeted him cheerily.
&ldquo;Picture all finished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s finished all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan pointed miserably to the mass of strewn
sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone wrecked it while I was down at the
river washing my hands. It makes me sick. All that
work&mdash;gone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ross Langdon must have been here!&rdquo; Chips
cried furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while I was around,&rdquo; Dan returned. &ldquo;Fact
is, I didn&rsquo;t see a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair to blame Ross,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield
quietly. He had been looking about the camp,
making a few observations. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you realize what
happened to your sand picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was stolen by the wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind! That&rsquo;s right, it did blow terribly
hard here for a few minutes! I was scared the hut
would blow down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, it was the wind that scattered the
sand,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield went on. &ldquo;Too bad you didn&rsquo;t
cover the picture with canvas before it was wrecked.
Or, better still, you could have used a little shellac
as a base to hold the sand in place. I&rsquo;m sorry I
didn&rsquo;t suggest it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take to re-make the picture?&rdquo;
Brad asked with forced cheerfulness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad
to help, only I&rsquo;m not very artistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan remained silent. At the moment he was too
discouraged to think of re-doing the sand painting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield flung an arm about his slumped
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck up, Dan,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Practice makes perfect,
you know. You&rsquo;ll make an even better picture
next time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all help you,&rdquo; Chips offered. &ldquo;Maybe next
time we can do the picture Navajo style&mdash;all in one
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll almost have to, if we want to have it ready
for the pow-wow Saturday,&rdquo; Dan said with forced
cheer. &ldquo;Okay, fellows. We&rsquo;ll start in again right
after school tomorrow night. I&rsquo;ll fix some more
materials in the meantime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the spirit, Dan, old boy,&rdquo; Red approved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show him what we found at the cliff,&rdquo; urged
Fred.</p>
<p>Dan now noticed for the first time, that Red was
carrying a bulky, folded object. It appeared to be
an Indian blanket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found Professor Sarazen&rsquo;s blanket!&rdquo; he cried
jubilantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such luck,&rdquo; Red corrected. &ldquo;We did find this,
though.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>He spread a tattered red, white and black woven
blanket on the grass. Plainly it was Indian in design
and made on a hand loom. The pattern was
incomplete, for the blanket had been used until it
was fairly in tatters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find that?&rdquo; he asked the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the ravine,&rdquo; Red explained. &ldquo;While the others
were looking at the carved face, I went poking
around in the bushes back of the cliff. I found
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, maybe whoever left it, took our good
blanket!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my theory,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;The
blanket is worthless, of course. We just brought it
along to show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little more was said as the Cubs prepared to
start home. They took care to see that no items of
value were left lying about. Mr. Hatfield personally
locked the canoe, the paddles and all tools in
Mr. Halloway&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<p>Dan was bitterly disappointed over the loss of
the sand painting. However, his spirits were revived
by a good night&rsquo;s rest. By the following afternoon
he had assembled new materials and was
ready to start work again on another project.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time I&rsquo;ll outline the picture in a protected
place,&rdquo; he announced.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>While Dan was making the preliminary layout,
Brad and the other Cubs busied themselves with
canoe practice. At intervals the denner saw them
deliberately upset the craft, empty it of water, and
scramble in. This accomplished, they would paddle
back to shore.</p>
<p>Dan worked doggedly, determined to keep at his
task, though he had lost enthusiasm for it. For the
second sand painting, the boy had chosen a more
secluded spot, well protected by a wind-break of
trees.</p>
<p>As he outlined geometrical figures with a sharp-pointed
stick, he became aware of a rather uncomfortable
feeling. At intervals Dan would glance
over his shoulder, feeling that he was being
watched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with me, anyhow?&rdquo; he asked
himself in disgust. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting more nervous than
an old cat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to concentrate on the work before him.
But he could not rid himself of that strange, uncomfortable
sensation that he was being watched.</p>
<p>Glancing over his shoulder, he actually saw a
shadowy face peering down at him from the foliage
on the slope above. Or did he imagine that too?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>Dropping his stick, Dan glanced quickly about
the camp. The Cubs were still on the river, receiving
instruction in canoeing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am seeing things!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Anyway,
I&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scrambling up the slope, Dan boldly entered the
fringe of woods.</p>
<p>Distinctly, he heard a faint rustling sound, and
the crackle of a stick. Someone <i>had</i> been watching
him! That person now was moving rapidly away.</p>
<p>Dan moved faster. Now deep among the trees,
he could see no one. It was as if he were chasing
a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp!</p>
<p>Finally giving up, the boy returned to the slope
directly above the site he had selected for the sand
painting.</p>
<p>A gap in the tree branches, he noted, permitted
a perfect view not only of the camp but also of the
picture he had started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone was watching me, all right,&rdquo; he
thought. &ldquo;Wonder if it was Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carefully, Dan inspected the soft, moist earth.
At first he could find no footprints or other sign of
the watcher. But after he had pulled away a pile
of damp leaves from the trail, he discovered a print
which appeared to have been made by a moccasin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Ross,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;One of those Indians
is watching our camp. I don&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly troubled, the boy returned to the sand
painting. But he could not keep his mind on it.
What use, he thought, to go to so much work again,
with the ever present hazard that over-night the
picture might be ruined by a hostile stranger?</p>
<p>Presently, Dan sauntered down to the beach, intending
to tell Brad and Mr. Hatfield of his latest
discovery. The Cub leader was still out on the
river giving Midge and his son a few advanced
pointers on stroking.</p>
<p>Brad, he noticed, was talking to Red and Chips
farther down the beach. They were speaking rather
loudly and seemed to be deep in some sort of argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I brought the paddle in when I got through
with my turn at the canoe,&rdquo; Red said furiously.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to accuse me of losing it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not accusing anyone,&rdquo; Brad told him, holding
his temper in check. &ldquo;No use getting your back
up! I&rsquo;m just checking on the paddles, that&rsquo;s all.
We&rsquo;ve lost one and we can&rsquo;t afford to lose another.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ask Mr. Hatfield then,&rdquo; Red said peevishly. &ldquo;He
probably has the extra one with him in the canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know he has one. I don&rsquo;t think there were two
spares.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ask him,&rdquo; Red insisted. &ldquo;I know I didn&rsquo;t
have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming up to the trio, Dan asked Brad what was
wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another paddle missing,&rdquo; Brad answered briefly.
&ldquo;Or at least I think it&rsquo;s gone. I&rsquo;m not blaming anyone.
Only checking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting upon Red&rsquo;s suggestion, he called to Mr.
Hatfield to ask how many paddles the Cub leader
had in the canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two,&rdquo; came back the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re one short again,&rdquo; Brad declared
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it was stolen?&rdquo; Dan asked, instantly recalling
the moccasin track in the woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o.&rdquo; Brad spoke thoughtfully. &ldquo;I remember
when Chips, Red and I came in from our practice
session on the river, that paddle was laid down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right here where we&rsquo;re standing,&rdquo; Chips interposed.
&ldquo;It was fairly close to the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should have picked it up myself,&rdquo; Brad said.
&ldquo;I guess I just didn&rsquo;t notice, that&rsquo;s all. I&rsquo;m as much
to blame as anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paddle should be here,&rdquo; Red said doggedly.
&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It probably floated off,&rdquo; Brad answered. &ldquo;The
waves pound up here whenever a big cruiser passes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the paddle floated off, it can&rsquo;t be far
away,&rdquo; Red declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Brad. He turned to Dan.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go after it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much chance of trailing it that way. Maybe
Mr. Hatfield will let us take the canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had observed that the Cub leader already
was paddling toward shore with long, sure strokes.</p>
<p>The two Cubs went down to the water&rsquo;s edge to
meet him. Quickly, Brad explained what had happened.
As they had expected, Mr. Hatfield showed
immediate concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to lose another paddle,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to find this one, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Motioning for Brad and Dan to exchange places
with Fred and Midge, he pointed the canoe down
stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>For the next twenty minutes, the three searched
every cove and back-water along the shore. The
lost paddle could not be found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beats all what could have happened to it,&rdquo;
Brad said, resting a moment. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see anyone
in camp while we were out on the river, did
you, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on the beach,&rdquo; the younger boy answered
slowly. &ldquo;I did see someone watching me from the
woods&mdash;an Indian, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s no use looking any farther for the
paddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait. Let&rsquo;s not give up just yet,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said unexpectedly. He had been studying the swift
river current with deep absorption. &ldquo;Maybe an
Indian stole our paddle, but I doubt it. Notice how
fast this water moves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one little ribbon of it,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;I
discovered that the other day. This old river must
have a lot of currents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield nodded. &ldquo;On your toes, boys,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try an experiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; Brad asked, puzzled.</p>
<p>Without answering, Mr. Hatfield deliberately
dropped his paddle into the river.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER 10</span>
<br />AN UNDERGROUND STREAM</h2>
<p>Brad and Dan watched in fascination as the paddle
drifted away from the canoe.</p>
<p>At first it moved very slowly, then faster and
faster.</p>
<p>Brad noted instantly that the paddle seemed to
travel downstream much faster than the canoe and
also at a quicker pace than other drifting objects
nearby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s caught in an especially swift current!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;I wonder what causes that fast water?
An underground stream emptying into the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered myself,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared,
keeping close watch of the drifting paddle. &ldquo;Some
time ago, Mr. Holloway pointed out to me that a
fast current less than twelve feet wide moves along
shore for a considerable distance. We never took
time to trace it down or discover its origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paddle is caught in that current now,&rdquo; Dan
nodded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d thought of the same thing myself,&rdquo; Brad declared.
&ldquo;Fact is, I&rsquo;ve wondered if maybe those two
missing paddles didn&rsquo;t float away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Ross never took them,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fast-moving current passes close to the
beach,&rdquo; Brad said thoughtfully. &ldquo;Furthermore, each
time the paddles disappeared, they&rsquo;d been left
lying close to the water&rsquo;s edge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, Brad, it&rsquo;s a theory worth investigating.
We can&rsquo;t afford to lose another paddle. If we&rsquo;re
not careful, this one will get away from us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paddle which the Cub leader had dropped
into the water, was moving faster and faster. Pursuing
it, Brad pushed the canoe forward with deep
thrusts of the one remaining paddle. But with two
heavy passengers, he could not make the craft
spurt ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to take over?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield offered.</p>
<p>Brad grinned and shook his head. &ldquo;I need to
build up muscle for the Saturday race. You and
Dan keep your eyes glued on that paddle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>As the canoe proceeded downstream, Mr. Hatfield
outlined his theory regarding the disappearance
of the paddles. He reminded the Cubs of the
river&rsquo;s close proximity to Lake James, only a half
mile distant from their camp. Often on pleasant
Saturday afternoons, the Cubs had hiked there for
cook-outs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it strikes me that Lake James is at a somewhat
lower level than this river,&rdquo; the cubmaster
went on reflectively. &ldquo;Does that give either of you
a clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An underground stream might connect the
two!&rdquo; Brad said promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m thinking,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield nodded,
&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ll soon know. Notice, that floating
paddle is moving toward shore again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s traveling, too!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;Almost as
if it had a motor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if the river did carry away our two paddles,
that doesn&rsquo;t explain what happened to the
Navajo blanket or our cache of food,&rdquo; Brad remarked
thoughtfully. He shifted the paddle to the
other side of the canoe so that his arm muscle might
have a brief rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, someone deliberately took those things. It
bothers me, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indians?&rdquo; Dan interposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It could be.&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield spoke rather guardedly,
as if reluctant to tell the Cubs everything that
was in his mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been trying to run into those
strangers, to get a line on them. So far, I&rsquo;ve had no
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since the Cubs first had discovered the carved
clay face at the ravine, park officials had made several
visits to the site. Twice they had noted that
additional work had been done. But on no occasion
had they found anyone in the vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The park is too short-handed to assign a man to
watch the ravine,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;Eventually
the culprit or culprits will be caught, but it may
take time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the one who is doing the work is hiding
out somewhere in the woods,&rdquo; Dan volunteered his
theory. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;re likely to lose things until he&rsquo;s
found and put out of the park preserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;re going to lose another paddle if we
don&rsquo;t watch out,&rdquo; Brad directed attention of the
other two to the ribbon of current.</p>
<p>Despite his best efforts, the paddle again was
moving faster than the canoe. It had swung in
quite close to shore now.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>The Cubs never had visited this particular section
of the forest preserve. No trails had been built
in the area, for the underbrush remained thick,
particularly along the shore. Except for a narrow,
sandy beach, sheer limestone cliffs rose to a height
of more than a hundred feet.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield studied the wall of bushes overhanging
the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I see where that current goes underground,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;Quick, Brad! Bear down or
we&rsquo;ll lose that paddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad took several quick thrusts of his own paddle.
With a scraping of twigs, the canoe nosed into
a tangle of brush.</p>
<p>Directly ahead, the truant paddle had snagged
against a log which protruded from the water.
Beyond, the swift-flowing current seemed to vanish
into the cliff itself.</p>
<p>Barely in time, Mr. Hatfield reached out to
snatch the floating paddle.</p>
<p>As Brad now held the canoe steady, the trio
studied the face of the cliff with keen interest. The
water here was very deep, flowing silently into the
dense wall of bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edge in a little closer, Brad,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield instructed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>Brad obediently steered the canoe deeper into
the brush tangle. It was hard to keep the craft
pointed downstream, for the current kept pulling
the bow.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield pulled aside some of the heavy
branches. At the sight before them, Brad and Dan
sucked in their breath.</p>
<p>A torrent of water flowed silently, mysteriously
into a great, arching cavern. The three amazed explorers
could not see its end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cave!&rdquo; Dan whispered in awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our paddle would have been sucked in there if
we hadn&rsquo;t snatched it just in time,&rdquo; added Brad.
He grasped a tree branch with one hand, helping
Mr. Hatfield hold the canoe steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This explains what became of those first two
paddles we lost,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared. &ldquo;Undoubtedly,
they were sucked into this cave. Furthermore,
the underground current explains what&rsquo;s happened
to a number of things that have disappeared on the
river. Mr. Holloway lost a life preserver last summer.
He hunted for miles down-stream, but never
could find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t anyone know about this cave?&rdquo; Dan
asked, staring into the dark, silent water.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never heard it mentioned,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield answered.
&ldquo;The park people may have this underground
stream mapped, but I rather doubt it. The
preserve was set up only a little over a year ago,
you know. Parts of the area never have been fully
explored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was impatient to investigate the cavern.
The entranceway was very small, just large enough
to admit a canoe, but not with its occupants sitting
upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, if we all lie down, we can get in there,&rdquo; he
estimated. &ldquo;It will be a tight squeeze though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we wouldn&rsquo;t know where we were going,
or what we were running into,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield put an
end to his plans. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to learn what&rsquo;s inside the
cave, but we&rsquo;re not going to be foolhardy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if we can&rsquo;t shove the canoe in, how are we
going to recover our lost paddles?&rdquo; Brad demanded,
disappointed by the Cub leader&rsquo;s rejection of his
proposal. &ldquo;How&rsquo;ll we ever find out where the stream
goes or what&rsquo;s in the cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we never will,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not taking risks, and that&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>Actually, as he peered longer into the dim, dark
cave, Brad lost much of his desire to explore. He
could see that the current moved swiftly along the
rock floor. Even if it were possible to get the canoe
in for a short distance, it might be impossible to
work it out again against the stiff opposition of the
racing underground stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The water is swift,&rdquo; Dan observed, &ldquo;but it
doesn&rsquo;t look very deep inside the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had made the same observation.
He instructed Brad to pull the canoe up onto the
tiny stretch of beach close by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we are going to explore?&rdquo; the Den Chief
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. I want to probe the depth of the
water at the mouth of the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beaching the canoe, the Cubs searched and
finally found a long, fairly straight stick which could
be used as a measuring rod.</p>
<p>Following Mr. Hatfield, they inched their way
along the cliff wall, fighting bushes all the distance.</p>
<p>The ledge was so narrow that only the Cub
leader could peer into the cave opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Dan demanded eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but damp walls veering upward to a
rough, low roof,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield answered. He had
thrust head and shoulders into the opening, so his
words were muffled. &ldquo;I wish I had a flashlight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want me to go back for one?&rdquo; Brad asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield turned down the offer, pointing out
that the hour already was late. By the time Brad
could return, it would be nearly dark.</p>
<p>Carefully, the Cub leader measured the depth of
the water. At the mouth of the cave, it was nearly
waist level. But a foot inside the entrance, the
depth was six inches less.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m mistaken, the floor of the cave slopes
upward,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then farther back, you think the water might
not be so deep?&rdquo; Dan questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it looks from here. I can&rsquo;t see
very far though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, wait &rsquo;till the Cubs hear about this cave!&rdquo;
Brad chuckled. &ldquo;And won&rsquo;t we have it all over the
Den 1 fellows! I sure wish we knew what&rsquo;s back
in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had completed his inspection of the
entranceway. He now backed away to rejoin Dan
and Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might be able to explore it,&rdquo; he said, dubiously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Today?&rdquo; Dan&rsquo;s voice became electric with anticipation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s definitely out. We&rsquo;d need flashlights
and lots of batteries, a good stout rope and maybe
some other equipment. Besides, I&rsquo;d want Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s
opinion before tackling it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can we do it?&rdquo; Brad demanded. &ldquo;Tomorrow
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield conceded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making
no promises though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that they could learn no more, the Cubs
were eager to return to camp to tell their Den
mates of the exciting discovery. Launching the
canoe, both Dan and Brad paddled. However, it
was hard work, moving against the current.</p>
<p>Nearly twenty minutes elapsed before the trio
came within hailing distance of the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it&rsquo;s just as well not to mention the cave
tonight,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield remarked. &ldquo;I want the Cubs
to know about it eventually. But if they learn about
it too soon, it may get them all excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And take their minds off the pow-wow,&rdquo; Dan
added with a laugh. &ldquo;We still have a lot of work
to do around the camp before Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>As the canoe slipped in toward the beach, Chips
and Midge came running down to help pull the
craft up on shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, Mr. Hatfield,&rdquo; Chips exclaimed in relief.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure glad you&rsquo;re back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong, Chips?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not exactly.&rdquo; The boy lowered his voice.
&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got visitors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong with that is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait until you see &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Chips muttered. &ldquo;Our
visitors are two Indians! Eagle Feather and White
Nose. They&rsquo;ve been giving the camp the once over
and acting awfully queer about it. The Cubs want
you to come quick, Mr. Hatfield!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER 11</span>
<br />FRIEND OR FOE?</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come right away,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reassured
Chips and Midge. &ldquo;No reason to be alarmed though.
Indians don&rsquo;t carry tomahawks these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; Chips replied quickly, &ldquo;but these
boys both have knives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look fierce too,&rdquo; added Midge, with a
nervous glance over his shoulder. &ldquo;Fred and Red
are talking to &rsquo;em, trying to keep watch so they
won&rsquo;t take anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be very glad to meet the pair,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said, starting up the path from the beach. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
though, that there&rsquo;s no cause for uneasiness. They
are probably only curious to learn what we&rsquo;re doing
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious isn&rsquo;t a strong enough word,&rdquo; Chips informed
him. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve snooped into everything&mdash;the
hogan, the Wells Fargo station we&rsquo;re building
and they made a lot of remarks about the sand
painting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Complimentary ones, I hope,&rdquo; grinned Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Nose said something in his own Navajo
language,&rdquo; Midge informed him. &ldquo;Then he spat on
the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; Dan said indignantly. &ldquo;I may
not be an artist, but my picture isn&rsquo;t that bad. I&rsquo;m
going to give that old Indian a chunk of my mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me handle this, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said.</p>
<p>He went ahead of the Cubs to the hogan where
Fred, Mack and Red were talking to the two Indians.
The pair did not appear unfriendly, but as
Chips had said, their inspection of the camp had
not been very polite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield introduced himself.
He extended his hand, and gave his name.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the Cub leader here. Anything we can do for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither White Nose or Eagle Feather made reply.
They looked Mr. Hatfield over and silently
accepted his proffered hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a Cub Scout outfit,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield went
on pleasantly enough. &ldquo;Our camp may look rather
odd to you, but we&rsquo;re preparing for an Indian pow-wow.
The boys chose the Navajo theme. Maybe
you can help us with a few suggestions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cub Scouts!&rdquo; Eagle Feather repeated. &ldquo;A good
organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Navajos are starting their own dens now,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield went on, trying to act friendly. &ldquo;In
fact, our boys are gathering clothing to be sent out
to New Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is good,&rdquo; Eagle Feather responded stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything we can do for you?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
next inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Eagle Feather shrugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are searching for someone perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For one of our brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not find him here,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield.
&ldquo;However, someone has been making himself at
home in our camp during our absence. We&rsquo;ve lost
food, and a valuable Navajo blanket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This information obviously was of great interest
to the two Indians. But their only show of it was a
sparkle of the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, get the blanket that was picked up near
the ravine,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield instructed.</p>
<p>Dan ran to fetch it. As he brought it back, Eagle
Feather quickly took it from his hand. He and
White Nose both examined the tattered blanket
intently, talking earnestly in their own language.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They recognize that blanket, all right,&rdquo; Red
whispered to Midge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Either it&rsquo;s theirs, or it belongs to that &lsquo;brother&rsquo;
they claim to be looking for,&rdquo; Midge added.</p>
<p>The two Indians did not explain the reason for
their interest in the blanket. After their brief but
thorough examination, they lost all interest in the
item.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield was rather annoyed by the visitors&rsquo;
attitude. He did not like the cool manner in which
they had made themselves at home in the camp.
Nevertheless, he hesitated to order them away, feeling
that it would be much better to try to make
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re Navajos, I believe,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Eagle Feather, &ldquo;we are of the
People.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs would appreciate a little first hand
information. How about giving us a talk on the
customs and traditions of your people? For instance,
you might tell us about the origin of the
Fire Dance. We&rsquo;re trying to work one up for presentation
at our pow-wow Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>The Cubs, especially Dan and Brad, expected
Eagle Feather to refuse. But, to their surprise, he
appeared flattered by the request.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield motioned for the Cubs to gather
about in a semi-circle. Eagle Feather squatted in
the center and began to talk, speaking formally,
but in perfect English.</p>
<p>He told the Cubs that the Navajos had 27 major
chants which they used on ceremonial occasions
or for the cure of the sick.</p>
<p>The Fire Dance, or Mountain Chant as it sometimes
was called, was the most showy of all the
Navajos&rsquo; ceremonies, he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The medicine man&rsquo;s whistle marks the start of
the dance,&rdquo; Eagle Feather described it. &ldquo;Twelve
dancers with their bodies sprayed white, come in
bearing cedar bark torches. As they dance about
the log fire, they sing the Fire Dance song about a
Sleepy Owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leader throws a bundle of burning bark to
the East. Three other bundles are lighted and
hurled to the West, North and South. This, my
people believe, will drive away colds and bad luck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The dance ends with the lighting of torches and
a wild race about the fire. The dancers move faster
and faster, fanning their torches into a long flame.
The ceremony lasts until daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll offer a simplified version of the Fire Dance
at our pow-wow,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared. &ldquo;The
Cubs are using flashlights instead of torches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us about other dances,&rdquo; urged Dan.</p>
<p>Now that his tongue had been loosened, Eagle
Feather was willing enough to talk. He described
other versions of the fire Dance, the Feather Dance
and one which he called the Plumed Arrow.</p>
<p>He then told the Cubs a few Navajo words.
Medicine man, he said, was <i>Hah-tahnc</i>, and sand
painting, <i>ee-kah</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your <i>ee-kah</i> very bad,&rdquo; Eagle-Feather added, a
suggestion of a smile lighting his grim countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Dan admitted with a laugh. &ldquo;But
then, it&rsquo;s the first sand painting I ever attempted.
The second, to be exact. Our first one was ruined&mdash;by
the wind I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us some Indian stories,&rdquo; urged Mack. &ldquo;One
about medicine men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The request brought a strange reaction from the
two Indians. Immediately they seemed to become
less friendly and more grim. Even the tone of Eagle
Feather&rsquo;s voice changed as he said:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will relate a tale of truth, one that concerns a
medicine man of our own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A traitor and a thief,&rdquo; muttered White Nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This medicine man once was highly respected
by his followers,&rdquo; related Eagle Feather. &ldquo;He was
trusted by the people who placed in his hands many
valuable tribal treasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ancient turquoise rings found in the old cliff
dwellings,&rdquo; murmured White Nose. &ldquo;Sky blue and
hard as glass. Silver necklaces and discs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The greatest treasure of all was the turquoise
toad,&rdquo; went on Eagle Feather, his voice as flinty as
stone. &ldquo;It was a handsomely carved piece, worth
a large sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the turquoise toad?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
inquired as Eagle Feather became silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day the medicine man vanished. With him
went the turquoise treasure. But the vengeance of
the tribe will follow him! He will never escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A fierce expression came over Eagle Feather&rsquo;s
leathery face. As the Indian straightened up from
a crouched position, Chips instinctively backed
away. Thrown off balance, he collapsed against
Mack.</p>
<p>A strained silence had fallen upon the Cubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>Eagle Feather&rsquo;s story had produced an unpleasant
effect on everyone. Even Mr. Hatfield felt strangely
uneasy in the presence of the two Indians. He tried
to hide his own misgiving by saying pleasantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for telling us so much about the Navajos.
I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s been very interesting. Goodbye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eagle Feather&rsquo;s thin lips loosened into a hard
smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may return,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;White Nose and I
have a mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Indians turned and with dignity moved
off into the woods. Not even the rustle of a dry
leaf or the crackle of a stick marked their leave-taking.</p>
<p>For a long while after the pair had gone, no one
spoke. Finally Brad broke the painful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friendly chaps, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet a Lincoln penny they took Professor
Sarazen&rsquo;s blanket!&rdquo; Chips burst out. &ldquo;Or at least
they know who did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so loud, Chips,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield warned.
&ldquo;They may be within hearing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you think of that tale they told about
the medicine man?&rdquo; Dan asked Mr. Hatfield, keeping
his voice low.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It gave me an uncomfortable feeling. I don&rsquo;t
know what those two Indians are doing in Webster
City, but I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re here for no good purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we report &rsquo;em to the police?&rdquo; suggested
Midge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far they&rsquo;ve done nothing that would warrant
a complaint,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied. &ldquo;All the same,
I dislike the way they&rsquo;re apparently watching our
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they think we&rsquo;re hiding someone?&rdquo; demanded
Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re after that guy who does the carving at
the ravine!&rdquo; Brad exclaimed. &ldquo;Y&rsquo;know we ought to
tip him off. White Nose and Eagle Feather could
be very bad medicine, if one met &rsquo;em on a dark
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield spoke firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will concern themselves
with organization affairs. We&rsquo;re not getting mixed
in any tribal feuds. Get that straight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the Cubs, speaking as one.
And Red added: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do
with &rsquo;em, even if you&rsquo;d give me a prize turquoise
toad!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;From now on,&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield, issuing a
further order, &ldquo;no one is to remain in camp alone.
Mr. Holloway or I always will try to be here. But,
if for any reason, we&rsquo;re called to the house, two
Cubs always must stay to look after our stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs accepted the order soberly. With more
than their usual care, they began gathering up their
belongings for the night. Though Mr. Hatfield
hadn&rsquo;t said so in plain words, they knew that he
distrusted the two Indians and was afraid that they
might cause real trouble.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER 12</span>
<br />EXPLORING THE CAVE</h2>
<p>The following day, Dan and Brad discussed the
discovery of the underground stream and cave with
both Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway.</p>
<p>Acting on a theory that the swift river current
must connect with Lake James at a slightly lower
level, the two men went on a tour of inspection.
They found the point upstream where the underground
river flowed into the larger stream, but not
where it later emptied into the lake.</p>
<p>Dan pleaded for a chance to explore the cave,
pointing out that the lost paddles might be caught
somewhere deep in the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need those paddles too,&rdquo; he added persuasively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be interested in exploring for its
own sake?&rdquo; the cubmaster joked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan grinned. &ldquo;It would be top adventure!
Our secret is too good to keep from the other
Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway were of the same
opinion. So when the Cubs had their next gathering,
they were told of the discovery.</p>
<p>Immediately there was a clamor to explore the
cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right now!&rdquo; Midge insisted. &ldquo;Lead us to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Cubs echoed his demand. Mr. Hatfield
and Mr. Holloway had, of course, anticipated
the request and were prepared for it.</p>
<p>The night before they had discussed the matter
and had decided to undertake the exploration. A
long light rope had been obtained, as well as an
ample supply of powerful flashlights and extra batteries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield consented to the request.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll explore the cave, if it can be done safely.
Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about leaving someone to watch our
camp,&rdquo; Brad reminded the group. &ldquo;It seems that
something disappears every time we turn our
backs.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>The Cubs stood watching Mr. Hatfield rather
anxiously. No one wanted to be assigned to remain
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, except for a few tools, we have nothing
here today of great value,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
take a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs proceeded to the site of the cave, following
Mr. Hatfield, Brad and Dan along the shore.
Tangles of brush and willows frequently caused
the group to detour away from the river. So when
finally they located the mouth of the cavern again,
it was much later than the Cub leader had expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no time to waste,&rdquo; he told the Cubs.
&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford to be caught here after dark. Now
everyone must obey orders. I know you&rsquo;re all eager
to see the inside of the cave, but it may be unsafe.
Therefore, I&rsquo;ll go in ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not alone!&rdquo; Brad protested quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Holloway will remain at the entranceway,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield resumed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take two Cubs with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; interposed Mack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, let me go!&rdquo; cried Chips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The stream is swift and it may be deep,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield went on, paying no attention to the demands.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to inch our way very cautiously.
Naturally, the only Cubs I can take must be good
swimmers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad and Dan,&rdquo; Red said instantly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield was well pleased that the Cubs
themselves had elected the two boys, for he had
considered them the most dependable. Dan in particular,
swam like a fish, and could be depended
upon if an aquatic emergency arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arm yourselves with long, stout sticks,&rdquo; he instructed.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be useful in feeling our way. No
telling either, what we may run into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs obtained the sticks from the beach,
and they presented themselves again at the yawning
mouth of the cavern.</p>
<p>A narrow stream of fast-moving water flowed
silently into the dark tunnel of rock. Gazing into
its mysterious depths, the other Cubs were not too
reluctant to have Dan and Brad do the initial exploring.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield tied a long length of rope about his
waist, and gave shorter ones to Brad and Dan, who
were to follow him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No telling how far this cave goes,&rdquo; he commented.
&ldquo;If our rope doesn&rsquo;t hold out, we may
have to come back and try it again some other
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cub leader gave careful instructions. Brad
and Dan were to follow him into the cave. Two
jerks of a rope in quick succession would signal
the waiting Cubs that they were to pull in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll not give the signal unless we&rsquo;re in
trouble,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway manned the rope attached to the
Cub leader&rsquo;s waist. Chips and Midge grabbed
Dan&rsquo;s rope, while the other Cubs took the one
Brad had tied about his middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful not to do any pulling unless you
catch a signal or are sure we&rsquo;re in trouble,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield admonished. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for any mishaps,
but it&rsquo;s always wise to be prepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go!&rdquo; urged Brad, eager to be at the job.</p>
<p>A silence fell upon the group as the three stood
for a moment gazing into the dark jaws of the cave.
The shadow of a tree shrouded the entranceway,
and the moving branches made an eerie pattern
upon the limestone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Brad and Dan nodded. Both suddenly seemed
to have lost their voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk carefully and watch your footing,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield instructed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let your rope get
tangled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped from the ledge into the flowing
stream. The water came well above his knees, and
somewhat higher on Brad and Dan.</p>
<p>Finding the floor of the cavern smooth, the Cub
leader moved along, slowly at first and then a little
faster. Brad followed a few paces behind with Dan
bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>Damp, dripping walls veered to a high rough
roof only a few inches above their heads. Now and
then Mr. Hatfield had to stoop to proceed. At one
point he thought he could not go on. However,
after he had squeezed through the &ldquo;low bridge,&rdquo;
the passageway became higher.</p>
<p>Pausing to rest a moment, the three gazed back.
The opening of the cave appeared as a circle of
light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s okay!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield shouted to reassure
Mr. Holloway and the Cubs who waited
anxiously at the cave&rsquo;s mouth. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t see the
end yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice echoed weirdly in the cavernous
depths.</p>
<p>Losing his balance, Dan grasped a jagged projection
of rock for support. The walls at this point
were slimy and covered with clusters of lichens.
Farther on, the explorers passed an oozing icicle-like
stalagmite which dangled from the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need any ornaments for your Christmas tree?&rdquo;
Dan joked.</p>
<p>Brad&rsquo;s line had become twisted. Without answering
Dan, he halted to try to straighten it.</p>
<p>Unaware that the two boys had stopped, Mr.
Hatfield moved on some distance ahead. Suddenly
they heard him shout:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re coming to the end of the tunnel!
Or at least to a larger chamber. I&rsquo;m out of the
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad hastily adjusted his rope and the two Cubs
splashed on. Mr. Hatfield was waiting for them
on a narrow ledge to the right of the stream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Before the amazed eyes of the two boys spread
a large chamber, nearly circular in shape. Occupying
a large portion of the cathedral-like room was a
round pool, which in earlier years obviously had
been ground out of the rocks by whirling waters.</p>
<p>The underground river sought an exit at the extreme
end of the chamber, beyond view of the
Cubs.</p>
<p>A rocky ledge extended on three sides around
the chamber. The shelf was barely two feet wide
where Mr. Hatfield stood. Farther on, Dan and
Brad could see that it widened to a sizeable floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield warned as the Cubs
came on. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sharp drop-off here at the entrance
into the chamber. I couldn&rsquo;t probe it with
my stick. The pool must be over a man&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the end of it?&rdquo; Brad asked, pausing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as far as we&rsquo;re going today. Maybe it&rsquo;s as
far as we&rsquo;ll ever go. I&rsquo;m satisfied now that the underground
stream empties into James Lake. The
tunnel through to the lake may be too small for
exploration. I suspect it is, but at any rate, our
curiosity is satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ve found ourselves a cave!&rdquo; Dan said.
He caught himself talking in a half whisper. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
the Cubs be jarred when we tell &rsquo;em about this!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t found our missing paddles though,&rdquo;
Brad remarked. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you think they&rsquo;d be
floating around in this pool?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think so, unless they were sucked
on down the tunnel to Lake James,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
remarked.</p>
<p>He trained his most powerful flashlight on the
dark stream. No longer a whirlpool, only a slight
circular motion could be observed.</p>
<p>Piles of sticks and debris drawn into the cave
from the river, had accumulated against the rough
chamber walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s that over on the ledge?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>He focused his flashlight. The battery, however,
had grown weak, and the light annoyingly blinked
out.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield centered his ray upon the ledge.
The Cubs then made out a pile of balsam boughs
neatly piled against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Balsam!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;Freshly cut too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone must have been using the boughs for
a bed,&rdquo; Brad reasoned. &ldquo;Recently, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It does look as if this cave is being used,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s look closer at that balsam pile.
Be careful though. The ledge is slippery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan took a few steps only to halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to the end of my rope!&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s no joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make the ledge either,&rdquo; Brad reported.
&ldquo;The slack is practically all gone out of my rope.
I&rsquo;ll have to untie it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield ordered. &ldquo;Just
wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Dan and Brad remained on the narrow
portion of the ledge, he circled around to the
wider section.</p>
<p>Waiting rather nervously, the two boys found
themselves shivering. A cold breath of air seemed
to be circulating in the chamber. Their clothing
was wet to above their knees, adding to their discomfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish he&rsquo;d hurry,&rdquo; Dan muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
anxious to get out into the sunshine again. This
cave would give a fellow the creeps if he stayed
here too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had bent down to examine the pile
of balsam boughs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s been sleeping here all right,&rdquo; he
called to the Cubs. &ldquo;And cooking in the place,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you found?&rdquo; Brad demanded, for the
Cub leader&rsquo;s broad back blocked out the view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old coffee can used for cooking a stew, or
something of the sort. The rock is blackened from
smoke. The coals are still faintly warm to the
touch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! Then our cave dweller has been here
probably today!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, gazing quickly
over his shoulder. &ldquo;I wonder where he is now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield moved deeper into the chamber,
away from the pile of balsam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, here&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Dan and Brad did not learn what it was
their leader had discovered in the darkness. In
bending over he unintentionally had given the rope
about his waist a quick jerk. At the mouth of the
cave, the Cubs began to pull him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s coming
off? I didn&rsquo;t give the signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the rope jerked. To avoid being pulled
into the pool, Mr. Hatfield had to retreat backwards
around the ledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Those Cubs!&rdquo; he exclaimed with an annoyed
laugh. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re pulling me in! Either they&rsquo;re worried
because we&rsquo;ve been gone so long, or something&rsquo;s
happened at the cave entrance!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER 13</span>
<br />MORE TROUBLE</h2>
<p>As the Cubs at the cave entrance pulled steadily
on the rope, Mr. Hatfield was forced to move
briskly along to keep from being swept off his feet.
He jerked on the rope several times as an indication
that he was safe. The signal, however, seemed
to be misunderstood. At any rate, the steady pull
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Brad! Dan!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield exclaimed.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be dragging you in next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Dan had felt a tug on the rope about
his waist. He and Brad followed the Cub leader
across the rock shelf to the tunnel of shallow water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably getting late,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said,
splashing along. &ldquo;Either that, or something has
gone wrong at the mouth of the cavern.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>As the three proceeded toward the cave entrance,
the pressure on their ropes suddenly relaxed. Evidently
Mr. Holloway and the waiting Cubs now
realized that there was no need to pull the three in.
However, the trio continued toward the exit, knowing
that it was too late to do any more exploring
that night.</p>
<p>Coming within view of the cave mouth, they
paused in astonishment. The gap between the
rocks barely was discernible as a circle of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s nearly dark!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;No
wonder the Cubs decided to haul us in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in that cave a lot longer than we
realized,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield agreed.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway and the Cubs greeted the three explorers
eagerly as they emerged from the dark hole
amid the rocks. Once on the beach it was much
lighter, but the sun had set and long shadows had
fallen across the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t mean to pull you out of there,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway apologized. &ldquo;The truth is, we got worried.
We&rsquo;d had no signal, and it was getting late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did entirely right,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield assured
him. &ldquo;Time the Cubs are home. Everything all
right here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had one scare. It didn&rsquo;t amount to much.
What did you learn in the cave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield described the explorations, declaring
that he was almost certain the underground
stream emptied into Lake James.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just before we were hauled in, you made a discovery,&rdquo;
Dan reminded him. &ldquo;What did you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The object of our search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the paddles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of them. The other may be there too. I
was pulled in before I had a chance to find out.
The paddle I saw was back against the wall of the
cave, behind the pile of balsam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it get out of the pool?&rdquo; Dan speculated.
&ldquo;Someone must have fished it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, someone&rsquo;s using the cave all right,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield responded. &ldquo;A rugged individual accustomed
to living out-of-doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that mysterious fellow who&rsquo;s been doing
the carving at the ravine!&rdquo; Red exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield agreed thoughtfully.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well we didn&rsquo;t find him at home. We&rsquo;ll
turn the job of eviction over to the park authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we&rsquo;re not going to have a chance to
explore the cave?&rdquo; Chips demanded. &ldquo;I say! Dan
and Brad have all the fun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There will be plenty of time to inspect the cave
later on,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reassured him. &ldquo;But routing
out whoever is hiding in there isn&rsquo;t our job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway backed him
up. &ldquo;Anyone who would chose to live in a cave
must be either a fugitive or slightly demented. The
fellow may be armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were disappointed that they were not
to be given a chance to explore the cave for awhile.
But they realized their leaders had made a wise
decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke about having a scare while we were
in the cave,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reminded the Den Dad.
&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing serious. As we waited, Mack
thought he heard someone prowling about in the
bushes above the cave entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did too,&rdquo; Mack insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took us awhile to scramble up there because
the rocks are steep,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway went on. &ldquo;We
didn&rsquo;t find anyone. We had a feeling though, that
we&rsquo;d been watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You probably were right about it too,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost certain someone is living
in the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>The air had grown chilly. Dan, Brad and Mr.
Hatfield, whose clothing was soaked to above the
knees, had begun to feel rather uncomfortable. Mr.
Holloway proposed that they all hike back to camp
as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan, bringing up the rear of the procession,
were more silent than the other Cubs as
they scrambled over the rocks to the strip of beach.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon the many strange happenings of
the past few days, they were convinced that Mr.
Hatfield was right in assuming that the cave had
an inhabitant.</p>
<p>It occurred to Dan that the man who had taken
refuge there might indeed be the medicine man
sought by White Nose and Eagle Feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that bird, whoever he is, has
Professor Sarazen&rsquo;s blanket tucked away somewhere
in the cave?&rdquo; he mused aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was asking myself the same thing,&rdquo; replied
Brad. &ldquo;I sure hope we get another chance to explore
before too long. We ought to get that blanket
back before our Indian pow-wow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The camp near Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s home was shrouded
in evening shadow as the Cubs trudged in.
Heavy clouds had overspread the sky, causing
darkness to come on somewhat earlier than usual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed to have kept the Cubs so late,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield apologized. &ldquo;I hope your parents won&rsquo;t
be sore, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take everyone to town in my car,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
offered. &ldquo;Special delivery service tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs quickly went about the camp, gathering
up the few belongings they had left behind.
Everyone was relieved that nothing seemed to be
missing. None of the tools had been disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired, ready to leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; called Dan. &ldquo;I want to look at
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was exasperated. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re late now,&rdquo; he complained.
&ldquo;That Dan&mdash;he has to go kiss his sand
painting goodnight. He watches over it as if it
were a baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done a fine job on it so far,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
said warmly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll only be a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan, however, was gone so long that the Cubs
began to grumble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him anyhow?&rdquo; Fred
muttered. &ldquo;He must be caressing every grain of
sand! I&rsquo;m going after him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here he comes now,&rdquo; Midge observed.</p>
<p>Dan came quickly to the group. He plainly was
very angry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s happened again!&rdquo; he burst out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; Brad asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sand painting has been ruined! There was
no wind to amount to anything either! This time I
know it was done deliberately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, for crying out loud!&rdquo; Red cried indignantly.
&ldquo;Who is pulling this stuff? I say it&rsquo;s time
we get that guy and poke him in the nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs and their leaders went back with Dan
to view the painting. All trace of it had been obliterated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even my materials are gone this time,&rdquo; Dan
said bitterly. &ldquo;I mixed the colors so carefully too.
I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t blame you for feeling that way after
twice losing your picture,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said sympathetically.
&ldquo;This time we may as well forget
about it, Dan. You&rsquo;ve more than done your part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan remained silent for a moment, a little
ashamed of his outburst.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I could try it again,&rdquo; he said after a
moment. &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s short though. And there&rsquo;s no assurance
that the sand painting wouldn&rsquo;t be ruined
a third time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s doing it out of meanness!&rdquo; Red declared.
&ldquo;I still think Ross may have a finger in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just run into bad luck, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Brad
said. &ldquo;Our troubles began when we lost the paddles
and the blanket. Without a sand painting, I
guess Den 1 will outshine us in the handicraft contest.
But it can&rsquo;t be helped. It&rsquo;s not Dan&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to start another painting,&rdquo; Dan offered
doggedly. &ldquo;Maybe we could set up a guard
to watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield opposed this suggestion. &ldquo;Someone
would have to stay here on a twenty-four-hour
schedule, Dan. That isn&rsquo;t practical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; Dan admitted gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re tired and discouraged tonight,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
resumed. &ldquo;Suppose we decide what to do about
the painting tomorrow. Meanwhile, maybe Mr.
Holloway or I will have an inspiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the matter was left. As the Cubs started up
the slope toward Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s home, Mr. Hatfield
recalled that his hat was lying inside the
hogan. Telling the Cubs not to wait for him, he
went inside to get it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>A moment later he was outside the hut again,
calling excitedly to the boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back here a minute!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I want
to show you something!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER 14</span>
<br />RED&rsquo;S SLIP OF TONGUE</h2>
<p>At Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s shout, the Cubs, who had started
toward the house, immediately turned back.</p>
<p>Dan was the first to reach the doorway of the
hogan. He thought he could guess why the Cub
leader had called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something else stolen?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing. Take a look at this!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
focused the beam of his flashlight on the floor
of the hogan.</p>
<p>Dan sucked in his breath, completely taken by
surprise.</p>
<p>Skillfully laid out in brilliant colors, was a sand
painting. In scope it was far more elaborate than
the one which had been destroyed outside of the
hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you beat that!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;How did
it get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Mr. Hatfield could voice an opinion, Mr.
Holloway and the other Cubs had rushed up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>For awhile the hogan buzzed with excited conversation,
as the boys speculated upon how the
painting had been transferred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t really transferred, though the basic
design is the same,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield pointed out.
&ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s painting was broken up so that the same
materials could be used here to make this much
more elaborate picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did it, and why?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Ross, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; contributed Red. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t have that much skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This picture was done by an expert,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
agreed. &ldquo;An Indian, I&rsquo;d judge. Note the skill
with which the curving lines have been put on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why was the picture made here?&rdquo; mused Brad.
&ldquo;Why inside the hogan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I can guess the answer,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied. &ldquo;Navajo sand paintings usually are done
inside a hogan&mdash;often in the home of the person
for whom a &lsquo;cure&rsquo; is sought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the custom is to destroy the painting before
the day is done,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway added. &ldquo;By tomorrow
morning, we may find this picture wrecked
as were the others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I hope not!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed. &ldquo;This painting
is the best one yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be just the thing to set off our handicraft
exhibition at the pow-wow tomorrow,&rdquo; Brad declared.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll really have something nifty to show
the Den 1 Cubs when they show up for the canoe
race!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we take turns guarding the hogan tonight?&rdquo;
suggested Mack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m willing to take a
trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield turned down the proposal. &ldquo;Your
parents wouldn&rsquo;t want you up all night,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Furthermore, if you did stay up, you&rsquo;d be no good
for the pow-wow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want to lose this sand painting,
Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway volunteered. &ldquo;My
house is just up the hill, so it won&rsquo;t be a hardship
for me to keep watch. I won&rsquo;t guarantee to stay
here all night, or to prevent destruction of the
painting. But I&rsquo;m willing to check occasionally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and the Cubs thought the Den Dad
would be taking too much upon himself. However,
he insisted he wanted to assume guard duty, so
finally it was agreed that he should assume responsibility
for watching the river camp that night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now, hike for home, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield directed
when the matter had been settled. &ldquo;Get a lot of
sleep tonight. Remember, tomorrow is the big
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were thoroughly familiar with the program
that had been planned. Early morning hours
would be spent in last-minute preparations. The
pow-wow, a money raising project, would start before
noon and continue into the early afternoon.
Parents and friends of both dens had been invited
to attend.</p>
<p>In addition to an exhibition of craft items, a
canoe race, and minor athletic events, the organization
had planned an elaborate ceremonial. All Cubs
planned to wear Indian costumes which they had
made.</p>
<p>As a climax to the gathering, there was to be
guitar music around a camp fire and the serving of
&ldquo;treats&rdquo; from a chuck wagon.</p>
<p>A silver plaque would be awarded the den which
won the highest number of points in both craft and
athletic events.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Altogether, the Cubs felt that the pow-wow
would be one of the most successful ceremonial
affairs the organization ever had held. As an added
attraction, the leaders had planned a side trip to
the ravine where the parents and Den 1 boys for
the first time would be given opportunity to view
the mysterious carved face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had found out who carved the big
head,&rdquo; Dan remarked regretfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet it was
the same person who made this sand painting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very likely the same one who is hiding in
the cave,&rdquo; Brad muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Midge demanded, not catching
the mumbled words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, just talking to myself,&rdquo; Brad answered.
He knew that Mr. Hatfield was not yet
ready to reveal to the Cubs all of the observations
made in the cave. Therefore, he remained silent.</p>
<p>Now that it was decided Mr. Holloway should
remain to guard the camp, the Cubs were without
means of transportation into Webster City. Mrs.
Holloway, however, offered to drive them into
town. All reached their homes a little late, but in
time for dinner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow early,&rdquo; Dan told Brad as they
parted for the night. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a busy day ahead
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a good night&rsquo;s rest,&rdquo; Brad advised. &ldquo;Mr.
Hatfield is putting us into the canoe race as a team.
Midge will be a substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was pleased to learn that he and Brad had
been chosen to represent the den in the all-important
race. The announcement was not exactly a
surprise. For a long while everyone had taken it
for granted that the two Cubs would be selected.
By far, they were the best canoeists, with Midge a
close second to Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning,&rdquo; Dan bade his
friend goodbye.</p>
<p>True to his promise, he turned in very early after
putting a few finishing touches on his Indian costume.
When the alarm went off at seven o&rsquo;clock
the next morning, he was out of bed in a flash,
ready and eager for a full day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly brimming with pep today,&rdquo; his
mother observed as he raced down the stairs for
breakfast. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a beautiful morning too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan quickly assembled his belongings to take to
Mr. Holloway&rsquo;s place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Brad and I want to get there early,&rdquo; he explained.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been assigned to buy all the groceries
and take them out to Mrs. Holloway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you need help getting supplies to the camp?&rdquo;
his mother inquired. &ldquo;I can borrow the car, if
necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad and I won&rsquo;t have more than we can carry,&rdquo;
Dan answered. &ldquo;Thanks, a lot, Mom. You&rsquo;ll be at
the pow-wow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss it, Dan. I aim to see you win
that canoe race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure hope I don&rsquo;t let you down, Mom. Or the
den,&rdquo; Dan added with a grin. &ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slammed out of the house, whistling as he
went. The morning was bright, with not a hint of a
cloud in the sky. Dan drew a deep breath as he
started for Brad&rsquo;s house. He felt fine, as if he could
whip his weight in Den 1 Cubs!</p>
<p>At the next corner, Dan ran into Red, who had
been out making a last minute collection of clothing
to be sent to the Navajo reservation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on my way to meet Brad and go to the
grocery store,&rdquo; Dan told him. &ldquo;Want to come
along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Red agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Brad was sweeping the garage when the two
boys joined him at his home. The job was nearly
finished though.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a list of what we&rsquo;re supposed to buy?&rdquo; he
asked Dan.</p>
<p>Dan produced the scrap of paper Mrs. Holloway
had given him the previous night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Brad said, setting his broom
against the garage wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m through here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three Cubs walked briskly to the corner grocery
where they did most of their buying for the
den. As they entered, Brad suddenly gripped Dan&rsquo;s
arm so hard that it hurt.</p>
<p>At the counter, buying supplies, were White
Nose and Eagle Feather.</p>
<p>Dan and Brad decided to greet the pair casually.
Red, however, became greatly excited upon seeing
the Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s jump &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he whispered to his companions.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the ones who&rsquo;ve been making
trouble around our camp! Let&rsquo;s tell &rsquo;em a thing or
two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet!&rdquo; Dan warned, giving him a hard look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pipe down,&rdquo; Brad muttered. &ldquo;You want to get
us into trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>Red, however, was not to be silenced. Before
Brad or Dan could stop him, he walked over to the
two Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he said, to attract the attention
of the two Indians.</p>
<p>They responded to the greeting without friendliness,
continuing with the buying of supplies. Their
very indifference further angered Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to ask you some questions,&rdquo; he burst out.
&ldquo;And I want some straight answers&mdash;see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red!&rdquo; Dan remonstrated, trying to grab his arm.</p>
<p>Red pulled away. He had no intention of being
silenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First off, I want to know if you and White Nose
weren&rsquo;t the ones that wrecked our sand painting
and then remade it inside the hogan?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Eagle Feather now paid him the honor of being
most attentive. His eyes flickered with interest as
he demanded mildly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sand painting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you needn&rsquo;t pretend you know nothing
about it,&rdquo; Red snapped. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve both been hanging
around our camp ever since you came to Webster
City!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Your sand painting has been redone?&rdquo; inquired
Eagle Feather, speaking with precise English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; Red informed him.
&ldquo;Oh, you know all about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan tried vainly to pull his friend away from the
grocery counter. But Red, in one of his stubborn
moods, would not budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know nothing about your sand painting,&rdquo;
Eagle Feather said distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The work was done by an Indian&mdash;we know that
from the skillful way the picture was put together,&rdquo;
Red rattled on. &ldquo;It must have been you and White
Nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no skill at sand painting,&rdquo; said Eagle
Feather. &ldquo;We know one who does have cleverness
in his hands&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red broke in, not giving the Indian an opportunity
to finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;ve been living in the river cave on
the park reservation,&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>By this time Dan and Brad were thoroughly exasperated
by the rash manner in which Red was
revealing information. They were particularly annoyed
because they could see that their den mate
was supplying the Indians with facts of great interest
to them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this cave of which you speak?&rdquo; Eagle
Feather asked.</p>
<p>Dan stepped on Red&rsquo;s foot so hard that he howled
with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Button your flapping lips!&rdquo; Dan hissed into his
ear.</p>
<p>Belatedly, Red realized that he had talked too
much. He lapsed into a crestfallen silence.</p>
<p>But the damage had been done. Eagle Feather
and White Nose were keen enough to know that
Dan and Brad had sought to prevent their friend
from revealing the exact location of the cave. They
did not ask for more information.</p>
<p>Instead, they spoke together in their own language.
Then without completing their purchases
or paying for the ones already ordered, they hurriedly
left the store.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what got into them?&rdquo; the storekeeper demanded,
scratching his head. &ldquo;They order groceries
and then go off without taking &rsquo;em along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was the idea of stepping on my foot?&rdquo;
Red demanded indignantly of his friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to have stepped on your tongue,&rdquo;
Brad retorted. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had to blurt out about that cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought they knew about it, and the
sand painting too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You thought wrong,&rdquo; Brad said furiously. &ldquo;You
just fed them a lot of useful information. Now, unless
I&rsquo;m tangled up, they&rsquo;re out for mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mischief?&rdquo; Red echoed blankly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what you&rsquo;re talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Indians came here looking for someone,&rdquo;
Brad told him. &ldquo;When you mentioned the sand-painting
and the cave, you evidently gave them
just the clues they needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now they&rsquo;re on the way to find that cave,&rdquo;
Dan added. &ldquo;If they should find the man they&rsquo;re
looking for there&mdash;wow! Fireworks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Red mumbled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad thought fast. He handed the grocer the list
of supplies, asking him to fill the order as quickly
as he could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get out to the camp right away,&rdquo;
he told the other two Cubs. &ldquo;White Nose and Eagle
Feather are looking for trouble. If they find the
cave and the medicine man they&rsquo;re after, there&rsquo;s no
telling what they may do! We&rsquo;ve got to get there
first and warn him!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER 15</span>
<br />THE MAN IN THE CAVE</h2>
<p>Now that it was too late to recall the information
so carelessly given, Red was distressed by his
slip of tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; he asked helplessly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we
stop those Indians?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan already had rushed to the grocery store
door. By this time the two Indians were across the
street, walking very rapidly. He called to them, but
they paid no heed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find either Mr. Hatfield or Mr.
Holloway right away,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t&mdash;well,
Brad&rsquo;s right&mdash;no telling what may happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three Cubs were deeply worried, for White
Nose and Eagle Feather plainly were being driven
by thoughts of revenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about anyhow?&rdquo; Red demanded.
&ldquo;Why are you both so scared they&rsquo;ll go to the
cave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Brad shot back.
&ldquo;Furthermore, Dan and I haven&rsquo;t time to explain
things now. Come on! We&rsquo;ve got to get out to camp
right away or there may be no pow-wow today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly crestfallen to think he had made a
serious blunder, Red said no more. The three Cubs
quickly paid for the groceries, and with the sacks,
started off at a fast walk for the Holloway place at
the edge of the park preserve.</p>
<p>Enroute, Brad and Dan told Red of their fear
that the man sought by the two Indians might be
hiding in the cave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one was there when we explored yesterday,&rdquo;
Dan admitted. &ldquo;All the same, Mr. Hatfield found
plenty of evidence someone had been living there
recently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think would happen if White Nose
and Eagle Feather find the cave?&rdquo; Red speculated
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No telling,&rdquo; Brad answered. He quickened his
pace. &ldquo;You heard that story they told about the
stolen turquoise toad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh! You think the medicine man they&rsquo;re after
may be hiding in the cave?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wondering, that&rsquo;s all. If White Nose and
Eagle Feather should come upon the fellow unexpectedly&mdash;well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he stole the turquoise maybe he deserves
to be punished,&rdquo; Red argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Brad shrugged. &ldquo;But if I&rsquo;m any judge,
those Indians will do their punishing first and ask
questions afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had knives in their belts,&rdquo; Red admitted
with a shiver.</p>
<p>Reaching the Holloway home, the Cubs rapped
on the door. Mrs. Holloway did not answer. Noticing
that the garage door was open and the car
missing, Brad deduced that the Den Mother had
gone on a quick errand. But they did not have time
to await her return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to leave the groceries here on the
porch,&rdquo; he told the other two. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to find
Mr. Holloway. I don&rsquo;t suppose Mr. Hatfield has
come out to the camp yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Depositing their packages, the Cubs hastened
down to the river&rsquo;s edge. The camp was entirely
deserted. They saw that Mr. Holloway had been
working there, however, for wood had been gathered
for the ceremonial campfire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>Dan peered inside the hogan. The sand painting
remained in perfect condition. In fact, the entire
camp looked in readiness for the pow-wow. Yet no
one was around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too early,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mr. Holloway probably
went into town and the others aren&rsquo;t here yet.
We&rsquo;ll have to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad paced nervously in front of the hogan, trying
to decide what to do. As Den Chief, the decision
rested entirely upon him. The safe, conservative
thing to do, of course, was just to wait for Mr.
Holloway or Mr. Hatfield and let them take over.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he was afraid that any delay
might be serious. Although White Nose and Eagle
Feather didn&rsquo;t know the exact location of the cave,
it wouldn&rsquo;t take them long to find it, now that they
had a clue upon which to work. If the mysterious
occupant of the cave were to be warned in time, it
would have to be immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to try to get to the cavern ahead of
White Nose and Eagle Feather,&rdquo; he announced with
sudden decision. &ldquo;With luck, I may make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Dan insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not safe
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>Not wasting a minute, the three started off
through the woods. They were a considerable distance
from camp before they remembered that
they had not left a note for Mr. Holloway or Mr.
Hatfield to explain their absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may get back before they show up,&rdquo; Brad
said. &ldquo;I hope so, but there&rsquo;s no telling what we
may run into. I sure hope we aren&rsquo;t making a mistake
starting off this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an attempt to take a short route to the cave,
Brad chose an inland route. There was no marked
trail. Every inch of the distance was a battle against
the underbrush. When finally the boys emerged on
the beach, not more than a hundred yards from the
cave, they were worn from their struggles.</p>
<p>Dan suddenly reached out and jerked Red back
into the bushes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down!&rdquo; he commanded.</p>
<p>Red ducked low and then demanded in a
whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out on the river and you&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red and Brad both peered through a gap in the
foliage. Some distance upstream, but well within
their range of vision, White Nose and Eagle Feather
could be seen paddling close to shore in a red
canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re searching for the cave all right!&rdquo; Brad
observed. &ldquo;If they see us now, it will be a dead
give-away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs knew that their best bet was to lie low
and wait. Accordingly, they flattened themselves
on the earth, at intervals raising up briefly to survey
the slowly moving canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re starting the other way now,&rdquo; Brad observed
in relief. &ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t found the cave entrance
yet, and they may miss it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it&rsquo;s safe to duck in there now?&rdquo; Dan
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait a little longer,&rdquo; Brad cautioned. &ldquo;Until
they get around that bend in the river, we&rsquo;ll be exposed,
once we come out of hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs waited, nervously aware of how fast
time was passing. By now the sun was well up
over the treetops, beating down mercilessly upon
their backs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t have too much time, you know,&rdquo; Dan
reminded his companions. &ldquo;The pow-wow starts at
eleven sharp. Mr. Hatfield will be chewing his
fingernails if we don&rsquo;t get back in plenty of time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Brad remained silent, his gaze on the canoe. Now
that they were near the mouth of the cave, he
wondered if he had been rash to propose entering
it without Mr. Hatfield or Mr. Holloway along.</p>
<p>Even in broad daylight the cave looked forbidding,
and this time the Cubs were not supplied
with flashlights or candles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can give it up and go back,&rdquo; he suggested.
&ldquo;After all, White Nose and Eagle Feather haven&rsquo;t
found the entranceway. They may miss it entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance of that, if they come back this way,&rdquo;
Dan said significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mouth is well guarded by bushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Dan agreed, &ldquo;but look sharp and tell me
what you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Brad and Red peered intently toward the
cave entrance. At first they noticed nothing unusual.
Then they noted a thin wisp of black smoke
issuing from the jagged mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s got a fire in there!&rdquo; Red exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that smoke can be seen out on the river,&rdquo;
Brad added in alarm. &ldquo;This settles it! We&rsquo;ll have
to go in there and warn the guy. I&rsquo;ve got a hunch
Mr. Hatfield wouldn&rsquo;t want us to get mixed up in
this business, but what else can we do?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>Neither Red nor Dan were eager to enter the
dark cave, yet they agreed with Brad that the occupant
should be warned of his danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get on with it,&rdquo; Brad said briskly. &ldquo;You
two can wait here and I&rsquo;ll go in alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; Dan rejected the proposal.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stick with you. Won&rsquo;t we, Red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; the latter agreed, though without enthusiasm.
&ldquo;Lead on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the canoe bearing White Nose and
Eagle Feather had rounded the river bend and was
out of sight.</p>
<p>Rolling up the trouser legs of their Cub uniforms,
the boys removed shoes and socks, hiding
the latter in the bushes.</p>
<p>Then with Brad leading, the three scrambled
over the jagged rocks to the cave entrance. As they
stood there a moment, gathering courage, a little
puff of black smoke issued forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s in there, all right,&rdquo; Brad muttered.
&ldquo;You fellows follow behind me, and try not to make
any noise. We want to find out what we&rsquo;re running
into before we reveal ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>The swift-moving underground stream felt icy
cold as the boys stepped into it. Red, who never
had been inside the cave, felt especially nervous.
He kept close to Dan, occasionally bumping into
him.</p>
<p>Without a light to guide them, the Cubs could
neither see nor be seen. However, the bright mouth
provided dim illumination for a short distance.
After that, they were in complete and rather terrifying
darkness.</p>
<p>Brad, who kept ahead of his companions, found
the smoke increasingly unpleasant as he moved
deeper into the tunnel. He covered his face with a
handkerchief to ward off any inclination to cough.</p>
<p>Approaching the inner rock ledge above the
stream, Brad signalled his companions to be very
cautious.</p>
<p>The smoke had become thick, and ahead he could
see the faint glow of a fire. From the odor of the
smoke, he knew that game was being cooked.</p>
<p>Fancy was not playing a trick upon him, for as
the smoke cleared, he distinctly made out the figure
of a man crouched over the fire.</p>
<p>The problem of how to make themselves known
to the stranger solved itself most unexpectedly.
Red tried to smother a cough and could not do so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>In the silent cave, the sound echoed loudly.
Brad, Dan and Red flattened themselves against the
rough limestone wall. Too late!</p>
<p>The man crouching over the fire had heard the
cough. He started up, staring into the darkness,
directly at the three frightened Cubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER 16</span>
<br />DANGER</h2>
<p>Brad did not know whether or not the old Indian
actually saw them in the darkness. But he decided
to take no chance of being mistaken for an enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said, and his voice echoed weirdly in
the cavern, &ldquo;cooking your dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a show of friendliness, he stepped out into
the glare of the fire. Dan and Red followed his
example, though not without misgiving. Would the
old cave dweller accept them as friends? Or would
he be hostile? In the darkness they could not see
whether or not he wore a knife at his belt.</p>
<p>For a full minute, the old Indian stood tense on
the rock floor, staring at the three Cubs. In the
glare of the fire they saw that he was gaunt and
lean, with a bony, unwrinkled face. Prominent
cheek bones pulled the skin tightly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; Brad said, gaining confidence
as the Indian made no hostile move. &ldquo;Cooking a
rabbit, I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger replied with a deep-throated grunt
which the Cubs took for assent. He did not seem
unfriendly, however, only guarded and a trifle
dazed.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the old Indian did not question
the boys as to their unexpected presence in the
cave. Apparently accepting them as friends, he
motioned for them to share the warmth of his fire.</p>
<p>The Cubs squatted around it, watching the old
fellow rotate the cooking rabbit on a crudely fashioned
spit.</p>
<p>Without saying anything, Dan nudged Red to
direct his attention toward the wall behind them.
Not far from the pile of balsam boughs lay the
Navajo blanket which had disappeared from the
Cub camp a few days earlier!</p>
<p>Brad cleared his throat and after telling his name,
tried to draw the old Indian into conversation.
Aside from learning that the other&rsquo;s name was
Miquel and that he was a Navajo of the Beebitchni
clan, he made little headway.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Paying scant heed to the Cubs, old Miquel carried on
a sing-sing monologue in a tongue the boys
could not understand.</p>
<p>At intervals he broke into English, but the words
made no sense to the three listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turquoise Mountain, king of mountains, everlastingly
beautiful,&rdquo; the old Indian muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; Red mumbled into Dan&rsquo;s ear. &ldquo;What
sort of jargon is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Miquel did not appear to hear Red&rsquo;s remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does me no harm, no harm,&rdquo; he rambled on,
&ldquo;for I am Holy with the Fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of his head,&rdquo; Red whispered to Dan.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s completely lost his buttons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Indian had arisen from the fire, turning
dramatically toward the east. He made a picture
as he stood there in the flickering firelight, his
calico shirt open at the throat. In one ear he wore
a single turquoise ornament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The male porcupine eats gum,&rdquo; he entoned. &ldquo;I
do it in a Holy way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s reciting parts of a chant, I think,&rdquo; Brad
volunteered his opinion. &ldquo;Miquel hardly knows
we&rsquo;re here. Do you Miquel?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>The Indian went on with his chant, not even
glancing at Brad or giving any indication that he
had heard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in a mental fog, all right,&rdquo; Red insisted.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet though, that he&rsquo;s that old medicine man
White Nose and Eagle Feather are after!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing the two names spoken, Miquel paused
in his weird, meaningless chanting to stare at Red.
But a responsive thought chain almost immediately
was broken. He seemed to forget the two familiar
names as quickly as he heard them and went on
with his prattle:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am thinking of crossing the river.... I am
thinking of going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If White Nose and Eagle Feather jump him for
stealing, he won&rsquo;t go anywhere!&rdquo; Red remarked
uneasily. &ldquo;Brad, tell him why we came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try. I don&rsquo;t know whether or not I can get it
across to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den Chief began very patiently, attempting
to make Miquel understand that if he remained in
the cave he might be in grave danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Nose and Eagle Feather are looking for
you,&rdquo; he tried to explain. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re hunting for the
entrance to this cave right now. We came here to
warn you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; chimed in Dan, trying to drive
home the point. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ve done,
but White Nose and Eagle Feather are out for revenge.
Unless you want to get into trouble with
them, you&rsquo;d better move on to another hiding
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Miquel had listened attentively to the two
Cubs. They were hopeful that he had understood
at least part of what they had said. But when he
spoke, they knew they had completely failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rabbit almost done now,&rdquo; he said cheerfully.
&ldquo;We eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Removing the meat from the spit, he divided it
into four equal parts. Brad and Red refused a
share. Old Miquel&rsquo;s hurt was so apparent that Dan
accepted his share. However, he only made a pretense
of eating, as he watched the old Indian ravenously
devour the remainder of the food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s half starved,&rdquo; Brad observed in deep concern.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get him out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Dan asked. &ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t seemed to understand
anything we&rsquo;ve said to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad waited until Miquel had nearly finished
eating. Then he touched him on the shoulder, saying
in a friendly way:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Come with us, Miquel, to our camp. We&rsquo;re
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; the old fellow echoed in a child-like
way.</p>
<p>But when Brad and Dan attempted to lead him
away from the fire, he pulled away from them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t leave here,&rdquo; Red muttered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the use trying to help him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to,&rdquo; Brad said firmly. &ldquo;You can see
he&rsquo;s half starved. If those two Indians should come
upon him here, there&rsquo;s no telling what might
happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;We ought to get
him out of here. But how to do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs took turns trying to make the old Indian
understand. It was so much breath wasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He acts like a sleep walker,&rdquo; Brad remarked in
perplexity. &ldquo;Never ran into anything like it before
in all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he suffered an injury?&rdquo; Dan
speculated. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much of any
memory of the past. He just keeps mumbling those
chants.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>The Cubs did not know what to do. From Old
Miquel&rsquo;s appearance and actions, they were satisfied
that he was the medicine man for whom White
Nose and Eagle Feather searched so ruthlessly.
They suspected too that he was the one who had
carved the remarkable face on the wall of the ravine.
Likewise, he was the one who had taken
their Navajo blanket and possibly food from the
camp.</p>
<p>Had he also completed so expertly the sand painting
after perhaps destroying Dan&rsquo;s picture?</p>
<p>In the cave there was considerable evidence that
Miquel was indeed a man of many talents. On one
of the walls, he had marked a strange design with
charcoal. In another place, he had drawn characters
not unlike those which appeared on the completed
sand painting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting our time trying to make him understand,&rdquo;
Brad finally said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t persuade
him to leave, that&rsquo;s certain. Now what&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave him here,&rdquo; Red suggested. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get
along all right until we can get back to camp and
tell Mr. Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be safe providing White Nose and Eagle
Feather don&rsquo;t come along. But if they should find
the entrance to this cave&mdash;wow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why borrow trouble?&rdquo; shrugged Red, always
inclined to take the optimistic view. &ldquo;They were a
long distance down stream when we saw &rsquo;em last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they may return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they do, they&rsquo;ll notice smoke coming out
of the cave entrance,&rdquo; Dan predicted. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll
have to take that chance though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad nodded and warned: &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t stay here
much longer, unless we want to miss the Pack pow-wow.
We&rsquo;ve done our best to tip him off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting late,&rdquo; Dan said uneasily. &ldquo;You know
it took quite awhile to get to the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no one knows we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Brad agreed.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go. Right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were reluctant to leave Old Miquel
alone, for he appeared in a half-dazed condition.
They were certain that he needed not only food
and better living quarters, but medical attention.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it seemed hopeless to try to persuade
him to leave with them. Their best bet, they
thought, would be to go for assistance and return as
quickly as they could.</p>
<p>The three Cubs tried to tell Miquel of their intention.
It was obvious, however, that he did not
comprehend.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>They were ready to leave when Dan&rsquo;s keen ears
detected an unusual sound in the cavern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>Brad and Red already were aware of the sound at
the entranceway to the cavern. They distinctly
could hear splashing as if more than one person
were wading along the passageway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; Dan warned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those Indians probably,&rdquo; Brad whispered back.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve found the entranceway! Now we&rsquo;re in for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Miquel also had heard the sound, for he
listened attentively, though without undue interest.
After a moment, he went on eating his meal with
complete unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goof doesn&rsquo;t even know he may be in danger,&rdquo;
Red muttered. &ldquo;What are we going to do?
Those guys may prove nasty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad was worried. Plainly the men were moving
closer, for the splashing noises now could be heard
distinctly. They knew one of the men had stumbled
over a rock, for they heard him grunt as he picked
himself up from the water.</p>
<p>The boys looked about for a hiding place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Their only chance of avoiding detection was to
step far back against the cave wall, away from the
glare of the firelight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Brad warned.</p>
<p>To try to take Old Miquel with them was out of
the question. Retreating, the three Cubs sought
the innermost recess of the cave. Flattening themselves
against the moist wall, they breathlessly
waited.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER 17</span>
<br />RED&rsquo;S MISTAKE</h2>
<p>Scarcely had Brad, Dan and Red taken refuge
than two shadowy figures emerged through the
tunnel.</p>
<p>Watching tensely from a niche in the limestone
shelf, they saw Eagle Feather climb nimbly from
the floor of the underground stream to the rim of
the circular chamber.</p>
<p>He stood there silhouetted in the opening, the
firelight flickering upon his fierce features. In his
hand was a drawn knife.</p>
<p>Seeing the weapon, Red clutched Dan&rsquo;s hand in
a tight grip. He held his breath, fearful lest he
draw attention to himself or his mates.</p>
<p>The Cubs were more afraid for Miquel than for
themselves. But the old Indian medicine man remained
undisturbed.</p>
<p>Observing White Nose and Eagle Feather on the
ledge above him, he murmured, &ldquo;Ah-hah-lah-nih,&rdquo;
in affectionate greeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>White Nose and Eagle Feather leaped down in
front of the old Indian, their attitude hostile. They
spoke rapidly, fiercely in their own tongue.</p>
<p>Brad, Dan and Red could not understand what
was being said, though they caught one word
&ldquo;turquoise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They guessed, however, that the two Indians
were accusing the old medicine man of having
stolen the turquoise toad from the tribe.</p>
<p>Old Miquel began shaking his head in a bewildered
way. Abandoning the fire, he backed away
from his accusers.</p>
<p>Step by step, White Nose and Eagle Feather
pursued him.</p>
<p>Old Miquel backed nearer and nearer the edge
of the ledge.</p>
<p>To the horror of the Cubs, he suddenly toppled
backwards into the deep pool. He struggled briefly
and went down.</p>
<p>Before Brad and Dan could make a move, White
Nose leaped into the water. He submerged, and
seemingly could not find Old Miquel&rsquo;s body. In a
moment though, he was back on the surface, holding
Old Miquel by a lock of his long, black hair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>Eagle Feather helped to haul the old man out
on the ledge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done for,&rdquo; he said, speaking in English.
&ldquo;His head was gashed on a rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Gods have spoken,&rdquo; muttered White Nose.
&ldquo;Vengeance is not to be ours. They have punished
him for robbing his people of the Turquoise Toad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go,&rdquo; replied Eagle Feather.</p>
<p>To the horror of the watching Cubs, the two
Indians made no attempt to revive the old man.
Taking it for granted that he already was beyond
help, they quitted the cavern.</p>
<p>Brad, Dan and Red waited only until they were
certain that the two Indians did not intend to
return.</p>
<p>Then, they went quickly to the old man who lay
motionless on the ledge. Brad stripped off his jacket
and placed it over the wet body. The old fellow
did not stir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t under water long enough to have
taken much into his lungs,&rdquo; the boy declared, feeling
of the Indian&rsquo;s pulse. &ldquo;Got a handkerchief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan produced one which the older boy used to
staunch the flow of blood at Old Miquel&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He must have hit his head on a rock all right,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;But the cut isn&rsquo;t deep. It&rsquo;s mostly a
flesh wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s his pulse?&rdquo; Red inquired anxiously. &ldquo;Is
he still alive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. The pulse is so weak though that I
hardly can catch it. White Nose and Eagle Feather
evidently thought he was dead or they wouldn&rsquo;t
have gone off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo; Dan asked. &ldquo;Go for help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He needs a doctor right away. But I&rsquo;m afraid
to leave him here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he revives, he might roll off into the pool,&rdquo;
Dan agreed. &ldquo;Then he&rsquo;d sure drown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three Cubs huddled about the prone figure,
uncertain what to do. Aside from their fears for
Old Miquel they knew that their own long absence
from the Cub camp might have occasioned considerable
alarm.</p>
<p>By now they had lost all track of time, but they
were certain more than two hours had elapsed
since they had left Webster City. Soon it would
be time for the Pack pow-pow to start. With three
Cubs absent, the Den 1 boys would be frantic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>Dan searched in the darkness until he found the
Navajo blanket which belonged to Professor Sarazen.
This he used as an additional covering over
the old Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t leave him alone, that&rsquo;s sure,&rdquo; Brad
said with decision. &ldquo;Dan, you and Red, hot-foot it
for the camp. I&rsquo;ll stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re needed more than I am to run off the
events and take part in the canoe race,&rdquo; Dan replied.
&ldquo;Without you, Den 2 hasn&rsquo;t a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting help for Old Miquel is more important
than winning a competition, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; the younger boy agreed simply. &ldquo;But
you&rsquo;ll be needed while Midge can substitute for
me in the race. See what I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pack comes first,&rdquo; Red sided with Dan.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stay and let Dan go only&mdash;well, I might as well
admit it, I&rsquo;m scared to death to be here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither Dan nor Brad made light of Red&rsquo;s fears
for they knew that even an hour&rsquo;s wait in the cave
could prove a terrifying experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wasting valuable time,&rdquo; Dan urged. &ldquo;Get
going, you two. I don&rsquo;t mind staying. Honestly, I
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want Red to wait with you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. If the pow-wow is run off, he&rsquo;ll be needed
in camp. No use tying him down here when he
couldn&rsquo;t do any good. I&rsquo;ll make out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hurry as fast as we can,&rdquo; Brad promised.
&ldquo;The second we reach camp, we&rsquo;ll send a doctor
and some stretcher bearers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Den Chief clasped Dan&rsquo;s hand for an instant,
well aware that the younger boy deliberately had
sacrificed himself that his Cubmates might have a
better chance to win.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Old Miquel should come to, he might get
rough,&rdquo; Brad warned in parting. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take
chances. If he makes trouble, just get out of the
cave as fast as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan promised. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me.
I&rsquo;ll be okay. Just get to camp as fast as you can
and tell Mr. Hatfield what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With reluctance, Red and Brad started off
through the tunnel, not at all sure that they were
doing right in leaving Dan behind. But then, they
had no choice. Old Miquel must have medical attention
at once, or he might never recover.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the cave, the two Cubs halted
briefly to take bearings. White Nose and Eagle
Feather had vanished. The sun was well up in the
sky, indicating that the hour was even later than
they had anticipated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, I&rsquo;ll bet the pow-wow has started!&rdquo; Red
exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get back fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad edged around the ledge to the beach. He
was starting off the way they had come when Red
halted him with a suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a shorter way,&rdquo; he insisted. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s through
the woods, and hard going for a short distance. But
we can cut off at least twenty minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure of the trail?&rdquo; Brad asked dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t marked, but I know this section. Besides,
one can&rsquo;t get lost in the park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it!&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;Maybe
not permanently lost, but one could lose a lot of
time wandering around looking for a main road or
a marked path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not far from our camp, Brad. I&rsquo;m sure
of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay then, lead off. The important thing is to
get back as fast as we can. Old Miquel&rsquo;s life may
depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Confidently, Red started off, circling behind the
beach into a dense forest of towering trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>At first the going was quite easy, but as they
moved farther and farther from the water front,
the underbrush became more difficult. Soon they
encountered a swampy area which slowed them
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;re not making any time this way,&rdquo; Brad
protested, wading through a boggy place. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
strike back toward the beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The going will be easier as soon as we&rsquo;re through
this,&rdquo; Red insisted. &ldquo;I remember. Even though it&rsquo;s
hard going for a little while, we&rsquo;ll save time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had his own opinion. However, realizing
that it was too late to turn back now without losing
more precious minutes, he kept silent. He blamed
himself severely for having listened to Red. From
past experience he should have known that the
younger boy&rsquo;s enthusiasm often carried him away.</p>
<p>The swampy area behind them, the Cubs looked
in vain for a marked trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have hit it right here,&rdquo; Red declared,
deeply troubled. &ldquo;Well, it can&rsquo;t be too far ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not losing your way, are you?&rdquo; Brad
demanded. &ldquo;Dan&rsquo;s back there in the cave, waiting
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you into camp,&rdquo; Red cut in though with
less confidence. &ldquo;I may be a little mixed, but I&rsquo;m
sure of my directions. We&rsquo;ll strike the marked trail
any minute now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On they plowed, past fallen trees and then
through another stretch of mosquito swamp. By
this time Red was mud to his knees. The sleeve of
his jacket was torn, and his face had been scratched
by brambles. Brad was in little better condition.</p>
<p>For awhile Red kept doggedly on, the older boy
plodding behind him. Then they came to another
much larger area of fairly deep swamp. Both boys
halted, gazing at each other in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re lost,&rdquo; Red burst out, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s all my fault.
I thought I knew the way. Now I&rsquo;m mixed up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad did not blame his friend for he knew he
had tried his best.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t cross this swamp area,&rdquo; he said quietly.
&ldquo;We made a bad mistake leaving the beach route.
Now we&rsquo;ll have to retrace part of our way, and try
to hit the old trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will delay us a lot. And Dan&mdash;he&rsquo;ll be
expecting us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Brad said grimly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve let him down.
But it can&rsquo;t be helped. We made one mistake. The
important thing is not to make two of &rsquo;em. With
luck, we&rsquo;ll still reach camp before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER 18</span>
<br />THE POW-WOW</h2>
<p>Mr. Hatfield stood in the doorway of the
hogan, staring past the Holloway home on the hill
toward the main road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like Brad and Dan to be late,&rdquo; he remarked
to Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t guess what&rsquo;s
keeping them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red&rsquo;s not here either,&rdquo; the Den Dad returned
looking worried. &ldquo;The boys were here early&mdash;we
know that, because a sack of food was left on our
porch. But what&rsquo;s become of &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun had risen high and the hour set for the
start of the Pack pow-wow now approached. All
the Cubs shared Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s uneasiness. Without
Dan and Brad, particularly the latter, it would be
most difficult to carry on the planned ceremonies
and competitions.</p>
<p>Already the Den 1 boys were starting to arrive
for the big meet, many of them with their parents.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve telephoned to their homes,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
added. &ldquo;All three boys left early, presumably for
here. We know they arrived, only to vanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad and Dan wouldn&rsquo;t have wandered off without
good reason,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure
they&rsquo;ll be along any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outwardly showing no uneasiness, the two Cub
leaders went ahead with last-minute preparations
for the pow-wow. As the hour grew later, more
and more parents appeared upon the scene.</p>
<p>Fred, Chips, Mack and Midge were on hand,
all four togged out in Indian costumes they had
made themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can delay the start a little while longer by
taking the parents to the ravine to see the big
carved face,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;By the time everyone
gets back, the boys surely will be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway guided the assembled parents to
the cliff. Deliberately, he made the trip a slow one.
But when the group finally returned to camp, Red,
Dan and Brad had not put in an appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use waiting any longer,&rdquo; Mr. Holloway
decided. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to go ahead without them.
Frankly, I&rsquo;m worried. Something serious must have
come up, or they&rsquo;d be here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>The ceremony began with the Cubs from both
dens parading in a circle, about the camp fire.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield as Akela then emerged from the
hogan.</p>
<p>Solemnly, he raised his hand in greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; responded all the Cub Scout Indians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You my Indian brothers are the true first Americans,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield recited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo; again answered the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you promise to continue to do your best to
do your duty to God and your country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;HOW!&rdquo; the Cubs shouted, howling so loud that
the cry reechoed through the forest.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield directed the boys to seat themselves
about the camp fire.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway, who had a deep base voice, then
led the assembly in singing &ldquo;Home on the Range,&rdquo;
repeating it twice in the hope of gaining more time.</p>
<p>Next came the branding ceremony, or the induction
of new families into the Pack. All regular Cubs
were recognized as such by branding them as &ldquo;old
hands.&rdquo; Boys who had qualified for advancement
in rank next came forward to receive certificates
and badges.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Though Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway ran off
the ceremonies as slowly as possible, all too soon it
came time for the competitive events.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without Dan and Brad, we haven&rsquo;t a chance to
win,&rdquo; Midge remarked to Chips. &ldquo;It makes me sick!
After all the work we&rsquo;ve done. Then to lose out to
Den 1!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t lost yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but we will. You know that. Look at Ross
Langdon! He&rsquo;s strutting around like a peacock. Figures
Den 1 already has won the silver plaque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Deep gloom had settled upon all the Den 2 Cubs.
Their uneasiness was shared not only by Mr. Hatfield
and Mr. Holloway, but by parents of the three
missing boys. Repeatedly, the grown-ups whispered
together, apparently uncertain whether to continue
the pow-wow or to halt it and organize a search for
Brad, Dan and Red.</p>
<p>It was Dan&rsquo;s mother who decided the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pow-wow must go on as planned,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;My son wouldn&rsquo;t have disappeared without
good reason. I&rsquo;m confident he&rsquo;ll get word to us as
quickly as he can. Meanwhile, he&rsquo;d want the affair
to continue exactly as planned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Judging of the various handicraft items next began.
Above all else, the magnificent sand painting
for which Dan had been responsible, drew favorable
comment.</p>
<p>Unquestionably, it would have won top honors.
However, Mr. Hatfield explained that only the planning
work had been Dan&rsquo;s and that therefore the
den could not fairly claim the exhibit for points.</p>
<p>Judges awarded Den 1 ten points for a carved
tom-tom, eight for an elaborate Indian head-dress,
and three for a skillfully painted paddle. Excellent
examples of Indian weaving brought an additional
five points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a total of 26 already,&rdquo; Fred muttered in
alarm. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be whitewashed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll pick up,&rdquo; Midge insisted, with a confidence
he did not feel.</p>
<p>Judges now were grading the Den 2 exhibits. With
the sand painting eliminated from the entries, the
Cubs of Den 2 could not expect to attain as many
points as their competitors. Their only hope of winning
the pow-wow rested in the athletic competition.</p>
<p>Chips was highly elated to win ten points for
the paddle he had decorated. Fred added five points
for having the best Indian costume. Brad, though
not present, was awarded eight points for a cleverly
made bracelet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-three points to Den 1&rsquo;s twenty-six,&rdquo;
Mack added them up. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re behind, but it could
be worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first athletic event was called a &ldquo;Medicine
Man&rsquo;s Rassle with the Evil Spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield produced a three-foot length of
broomstick. The Den 1 boys stood on one side,
grasping the stick with both hands. On the other
opposing side were Mack, Fred, Midge and Chips.</p>
<p>Though Den 1 to show its sportsmanship, limited
their competitors to the same number of boys, they
were able to select their strongest Cubs. Den 2 had
no such choice.</p>
<p>Without Brad and Dan, they were greatly handicapped.</p>
<p>At the signal from Mr. Hatfield, each side tried to
touch an end of the stick to the floor. Den 1 succeeded
almost at once, achieving another ten points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-six to twenty-three!&rdquo; Ross Langdon
rubbed it in. &ldquo;Why, this isn&rsquo;t even a competition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, you!&rdquo; Midge growled. &ldquo;It could be different
if all our Cubs were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re already cooking up an alibi?&rdquo; Ross
gloated. &ldquo;Poor losers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so!&rdquo; Midge retorted furiously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
welcome to the silver plaque if you can win it. We&rsquo;ve
beaten you enough times before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad and Dan didn&rsquo;t show today because they&rsquo;re
afraid of being licked in the canoe race,&rdquo; Ross went
on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t they come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Midge admitted. &ldquo;They may be
here yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d better hurry then. The pow-wow&rsquo;s nearly
over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next scheduled event was an Indian dance.
The Den 1 group offered a rather uninspired number,
characterized by a noisy beating of tom-toms.</p>
<p>By contrast, Den 2 had planned an elaborate
version of the Navajo fire dance, using flashlights
instead of torches. Brad was to have led this number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred, you&rsquo;ll have to act as leader,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
told his son. &ldquo;Think you can do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sure try,&rdquo; Fred promised grimly.</p>
<p>The four Den 2 Cubs threw themselves into the
dance whole-heartedly. So spirited was their performance
that all the parents applauded vigorously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>After a brief conference, judges announced that
Den 2 had captured the event, winning back the
ten points they had lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-six to thirty-three!&rdquo; Chips chortled, taking
heart. &ldquo;Say, we still have a chance to win this old
pow-wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one more event remains,&rdquo; Mack pointed
out. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the canoe race.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re sunk,&rdquo; Mack groaned. &ldquo;Without Brad
and Dan, we may as well give up without even
entering the event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub doesn&rsquo;t quit,&rdquo; Midge said severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can we put in besides you?&rdquo; Mack demanded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re pretty fair, but there&rsquo;s no one else
to back you up. Chips, Fred or me&mdash;we&rsquo;re not in
the class of Dan or Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway held a brief conference
concerning the final event on the program.
They too were fully aware that without Brad or
Dan, the competition could not be won.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if we do trail miserably, we&rsquo;ll enter the
event,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield decided. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t have Den
1 saying we&rsquo;re poor sports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge is our best bet. He&rsquo;s very nearly as good
as Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But not the equal of Brad,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said
ruefully. &ldquo;And we have no one else. Neither Mack
or Chips is strong and they&rsquo;re only fair swimmers.
Fred can swim well enough, but he hasn&rsquo;t practiced
paddling enough to develop much skill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no choice,&rdquo; the Den Dad replied. &ldquo;It
will have to be Fred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short course had been marked on the river
with buoys. In this, Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway
had taken no part, leaving the matter entirely to
Den 1 leaders.</p>
<p>The two canoes were carried down to the beach,
ready for launching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now remember, boys, this is a friendly competition,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield warned. &ldquo;No straining to win.
Just take it in your stride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fred selected a paddle, his heart thumping. The
Den 2 boys were being very decent. Both Midge
and Mack had assured him that it didn&rsquo;t matter
whether or not the race was lost. But he knew
better!</p>
<p>Den 2, especially Dan and Brad, had worked like
beavers in the hope of winning the silver plaque.</p>
<p>Now, despite very bad luck, the score stood 33
to 36!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>According to the rules, ten points would be
awarded the two-man team which won the canoe
race. None were to be given for second place.</p>
<p>So, as it stacked up, the silver plaque and Den 2&rsquo;s
honor depended upon winning the competition.</p>
<p>But no one knew better than Fred how hopeless
was the prospect. Ross Langdon and another powerfully
built Cub, Donald Fall, were to represent
Den 1.</p>
<p>The boy watched them as they warmed up a bit,
dipping their paddles in perfect unison.</p>
<p>He and Midge could not hope to coordinate their
movements, for they never had practiced together.
Always it had been taken for granted that if for
any reason Dan could not compete, the team would
be comprised of Midge and Brad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so worried, son,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said,
slapping him on the shoulders. &ldquo;This race is only
for fun, you know. Win or lose, just do your best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Fred agreed with a grin. He gripped the
paddle so tightly that the knuckles of his hands
showed white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Ross and Donald take the lead, don&rsquo;t let it
worry you,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield added. &ldquo;Just stroke at your
own speed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Which will be plenty slow,&rdquo; Fred replied. &ldquo;Den
1 already is starting to celebrate victory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that several of the Den 1 Cubs were
capering about on the beach, laughing and acting
as if the plaque already were theirs.</p>
<p>In the stern of the Den 1 canoe, Ross flashed a
confident, almost arrogant smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we waiting for?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sick at heart, Midge and Fred took their own
places in the Den 2 canoe. Both crafts prepared to
line up at the starting point for the race.</p>
<p>Paddle poised, Midge chanced to raise his eyes
to gaze toward the forest. He stiffened into alert
attention. Dare he trust his own vision?</p>
<p>Midge brushed a hand across his eyes and looked
again. No mistake. From amid the trees emerged
two disheveled figures. Red and Brad!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; shouted Midge, letting his paddle clatter
into the bottom of the canoe. &ldquo;Hold everything!
They&rsquo;re here at last!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER 19</span>
<br />THREE POINTS</h2>
<p>To be left alone in the cave with only the unconscious
Miquel for companion, was an eerie experience,
Dan discovered.</p>
<p>A dreadful quiet settled upon the dark chamber
once Red and Brad had gone. Dan sat with his back
against a projecting rock, within reach of the old
man, should he stir.</p>
<p>The chill of the cavern began to creep into his
bones. He arose to feed the fire, noticing that there
was very little wood. Scarcely enough to burn another
twenty minutes. He dared not venture in
search of more, lest the old Indian fully revive in his
absence.</p>
<p>For a long while after his companions had gone,
Dan sat listening to the melancholy slap of the
waves at the mouth of the cave. He could not estimate
time very accurately. But as the fire burned
lower, he reasoned that Brad and Red should have
reached the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>At any moment now, he encouraged himself, help
would arrive. He hoped that Brad and Red would
get there in time to compete in the pow-wow. If
they did, his own sacrifices would be well worth
while.</p>
<p>Old Miquel moaned and rolled over on the rock
floor.</p>
<p>Instantly alarmed, Dan got to his feet, to place
himself between the man and the edge of the pool.</p>
<p>Feeling inadequate to the situation, he rearranged
the blanket, tucking it more closely about the figure.
Old Miquel&rsquo;s hands were icy cold and clammy
to the touch. The cave was cold and, in addition,
the elderly man&rsquo;s clothing was wet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may not last long unless Brad gets back here
with help,&rdquo; Dan thought. &ldquo;Wish I could do something
besides just sit and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took off his own light jacket and wrapped it
around Old Miquel. The Indian stirred again, showing
signs of regaining consciousness. Encouraged,
Dan began to chafe his cold hands, trying to restore
circulation.</p>
<p>Time dragged on. The fire died down to struggling
coals, leaving the cave colder and more terrifying
than ever.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>Dan huddled beside Miquel, watching the dark
pool. He could hear the underground stream gurgling
softly as it disappeared into the bowels of the
earth. Now and then an object, a tree twig, a board
or a leaf came floating in through the tunnel.</p>
<p>Already he had made minute inspection of the
cave&rsquo;s interior, finding only the remains of food
stolen from the Cub&rsquo;s camp. Obviously, Old Miquel
had taken it to keep alive. Of worldly possessions,
the Indian apparently had none except the clothes
on his back.</p>
<p>Dan sat motionless in the gloom, acutely aware
of a change in Old Miquel&rsquo;s breathing.</p>
<p>The sound was plainer now, harsh and labored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming around,&rdquo; the boy thought uneasily.
&ldquo;I sure hope he doesn&rsquo;t make any trouble. I might
not be able to handle him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan remembered Brad&rsquo;s advice to quit the cave
if Old Miquel caused trouble. But he had no intention
of doing so except in a real emergency.</p>
<p>As the minutes passed, the Indian became increasingly
active. At first, he merely tossed his
head from side to side. Then suddenly he sat up,
staring at Dan with strange eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s heart began to pound. He checked an almost
overpowering urge to turn and flee from the
cave.</p>
<p>After the first surge of panic, he quieted his own
fears. Placing a hand on Old Miquel&rsquo;s arm, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy. You&rsquo;re all right. Just lie still until
help comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan scarcely expected the old man to understand.
Therefore, it came as a surprise when Old
Miquel answered in plain though halting English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&mdash;am&mdash;I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, in the cave,&rdquo; Dan returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cave?&rdquo; Old Miquel&rsquo;s gaze began to wander
about the moss-covered walls as he sought to regain
his bearings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember what happened here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Indian shook his head, continuing to
stare at Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he presently managed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan Carter. I&rsquo;m a Cub Scout. Don&rsquo;t you remember
coming to this cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the Indian shook his head. &ldquo;I must get
back to my tribe,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Again Dan restrained Old Miquel as he would
have arisen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must lie still,&rdquo; he directed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurt?&rdquo; Miquel repeated parrot-fashion. &ldquo;The
fall from my horse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tumble into the pool of this cave,&rdquo; Dan corrected.
&ldquo;You struck your head on a rock or something.
What&rsquo;s the last you remember?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Miquel was silent for a long while. Dan
thought he never would answer, but finally he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember&mdash;riding through a canyon. My horse
shied at a rattler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the very last?&rdquo; Dan demanded. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you recall anything at all about White Nose and
Eagle Feather? Or the face you carved on the
ravine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Nose and Eagle Feather are my brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been after you,&rdquo; Dan informed. &ldquo;They
came all the way from the west, picking up your
trail here in Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the Indian&rsquo;s expression, the boy knew that
his words were not being understood. A theory
was taking shape in his own mind. From Miquel&rsquo;s
words, he believed that the old medicine man had
been injured some time before in a fall from his
horse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>This fall, perhaps, had shocked his entire nervous
system, causing a lapse of memory.</p>
<p>So perhaps Old Miquel had wandered away from
his tribe, unaware of his own identity! Now the
fall into the pool and another hard jolt had restored
some recollection of the past!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you recall coming to Webster City?&rdquo; Dan
questioned him.</p>
<p>Once more Old Miquel shook his head negatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember anything about a turquoise
toad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this question, the Indian&rsquo;s entire body seemed
to stiffen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was entrusted to my keeping,&rdquo; he replied
briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where is it now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; Old Miquel probed deep into his memory.
&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;cannot remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere in the west perhaps?&rdquo; Dan prompted.
&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t bring it with you when you came to
Webster City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The turquoise&mdash;it was hidden in a safe place.
No, that is not right. It was given to the white
trader at the reservation store. Now it comes back
to me. I feared the toad might be stolen. I gave it
to the trader to keep in his store safe until the tribe
ceremonial.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This must have been before your hard fall from
the horse,&rdquo; Dan deducted. &ldquo;But how did you get to
Webster City?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miquel could not answer. His only recollection
other than the fall in the desert, had been a vague
memory of having been on a freight train.</p>
<p>Exhausted from the effort required to talk, Old
Miquel cringed down into his blanket again. Though
he did not lapse into a stupor, he seemed to lose
all further interest in his surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know White Nose and Eagle Feather
came here to punish him for stealing the turquoise,&rdquo;
Dan thought. &ldquo;The old fellow&rsquo;s in a bad way. Gosh,
what can be keeping Brad and Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arose and went to peer down the dark tunnel.
Not a sign of any help coming! And yet Brad
and Red surely had had more than ample time to
get to the Cub camp and return with a stretcher.</p>
<p>Old Miquel apparently had regained his lost
memory, but nevertheless, he was in a serious condition
physically. He needed medical attention and
he needed it right away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Dan was quite sure he had figured out the real
story behind the old Indian. Undoubtedly, Old
Miquel had told the truth about placing the turquoise
toad in the trader&rsquo;s safe. When the old medicine
man was better, he should be able to furnish
clues which would result in recovery of the tribal
treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have wandered off the reservation, not
even knowing who he was,&rdquo; Dan reasoned. &ldquo;The
tribe members couldn&rsquo;t understand his strange disappearance.
Naturally, they figured he&rsquo;d made off
with the turquoise. So White Nose and Eagle
Feather were sent to trail him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was meditating upon the old Indian&rsquo;s interesting
past, when he heard a slight scuffing noise in
the passageway.</p>
<p>He listened eagerly. Had help come at last, or
might it be White Nose and Eagle Feather returning?</p>
<p>Fearful of the latter, Dan remained silent, the
blood coursing fiercely through his arteries.</p>
<p>Distinctly now, he could hear someone at the
entranceway of the cave. Abandoning caution, he
called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>The answering shout from Mr. Hatfield brought
intense relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here, Dan! Be with you in a jiffy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Powerful flashlights now illuminated the tunnel,
dispelling its gloom. The boy could make out several
persons splashing along the slippery rock floor. Help
had come! His long siege was at an end.</p>
<p>After that, Dan had no further worries. Mr. Hatfield
and Mr. Holloway efficiently took charge.
Aided by several of the Cubs from both Den 1 and
2, they carried Old Miquel out into the warm sunshine.</p>
<p>There, Dr. Evans, who had been summoned from
town, examined the Indian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He suffers from under-nourishment and exposure,&rdquo;
he told the anxious group. &ldquo;The head wound
appears superficial. If you can get him back to the
Holloway place, we&rsquo;ll take him from there by ambulance
to the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway and Mr. Hatfield personally supervised
the moving of the old Indian. They would not
allow Dan to help bear the stretcher, insisting that
because his clothing was damp, he must hasten on
ahead.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done more than your share now,&rdquo; the
Cub leader warmly assured him. &ldquo;You and Brad
hike as fast as you can for the house. Put in a call
for an ambulance, so it will be waiting when we get
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t let Red show you the way,&rdquo; Mr.
Holloway added with a smile. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not too good
at finding the trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had no intention of twice losing his way.
Taking no chances, he announced his intention of
taking the longer but better marked path.</p>
<p>Hastening back to the camp, the two friends
brought each other up-to-date on what had occurred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about the pow-wow,&rdquo; Dan urged after
he had revealed everything he had learned from
Old Miquel in the cave. &ldquo;Den 1 came out ahead, I
reckon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pow-wow isn&rsquo;t finished yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they didn&rsquo;t go ahead when we failed to
show up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the events except one have been run off. They
were just starting the last one&mdash;the canoe race&mdash;when
Red and I hit camp. We&rsquo;d have been there a
lot quicker only we got lost in the woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the score?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Den 1 leads by three points. But that doesn&rsquo;t
mean a thing. Whoever wins the canoe race, wins
the silver plaque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When does the race come off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Brad answered. &ldquo;Finding Old
Miquel has thrown everything into a mess. Maybe
now, the race will be called off. In that case, Den
1 wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For awhile, neither Dan nor Brad gave very much
thought to the pow-wow. Upon reaching the Holloway
home, they immediately telephoned the Webster
City Hospital, arranging for an ambulance to
be sent.</p>
<p>By the time the men came in from the woods
bearing the stretcher, it had arrived.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway both offered to
accompany the old Indian to the hospital. But as
Dr. Evans was to ride with the ambulance, they
were assured that it was unnecessary.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holloway provided Dan with a change of
clothing. Although the garments were a snug fit,
he did not mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a morning,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield remarked as
things quieted down a bit. &ldquo;Dan, now that I&rsquo;ve had
a chance to catch my breath, let me say, we&rsquo;re proud
of you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything,&rdquo; Dan said, flushing at the
praise. &ldquo;I just hope Old Miquel gets along all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will, I think. Dr. Evans says he&rsquo;s not in bad
shape and has a good, strong physique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s practically certain he&rsquo;s the artist,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield declared. &ldquo;The drawings on the cave wall
reveal his skill. Poor fellow! He seems to have no
memory of what he did after he came to Webster
City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonder what became of White Nose and Eagle
Feather?&rdquo; Dan worried. &ldquo;Someone ought to find
them and tell them the truth about Miquel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll attempt to locate them,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
promised. &ldquo;Just now, we have a pow-wow on our
hands. The Cubs haven&rsquo;t had anything to eat.
Furthermore, there&rsquo;s one more event on the program.
Or shall we call it off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; yelled all of the Den 2 Cubs. Chips added
quickly: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have the race now, and then our
lunch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield gazed thoughtfully at Dan and Brad.
Both boys, he knew, were somewhat worn from
their harrowing experiences of the morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be better to wait a day or so&mdash;&rdquo; he
began.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not on my account, sir,&rdquo; broke in Dan. &ldquo;Midge
can take my place, if you don&rsquo;t think I should enter
the race. I feel fine though! Rarin&rsquo; to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; grinned Brad. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re ready to test
our skill against Ross and Donald any old time you
say. The quicker the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you get beat&mdash;as you certainly will&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
say it was because you were tired,&rdquo; Ross twitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; Brad retorted.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, Mr. Holloway and the leaders of
Den 1 consulted over the advisability of holding
the race that day. Feeling was running a bit too
high, they knew. But then, there always had been
keen rivalry between the two dens.</p>
<p>The race itself was a very short one, not long
enough to place any of the contestants under
strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go ahead now since you&rsquo;re all so eager,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield finally announced. &ldquo;But remember,
this is a friendly competition. How you win is more
important than who wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the Cubs and their parents gathered at the
beach to watch the event. Fred and Midge willingly
relinquished their paddles to Brad and Dan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Win that plaque for us!&rdquo; Fred urged as the pair
took their places in the canoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sure try!&rdquo; Dan promised with a grin.</p>
<p>At a given signal, the two canoes were off! Ross
and Donald made a flashy start, immediately taking
the lead.</p>
<p>Flustered by being caught off guard, Brad and
Dan did not at once coordinate their efforts. By the
time they began to work as a unit, Ross and Donald
already had gained an alarming lead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dig in, Dan!&rdquo; Brad urged, increasing his own
efforts.</p>
<p>The course was so short that both boys knew the
race would be over almost before they could regain
lost ground.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s paddle dipped smoothly and fast. His keen
eyes sweeping the water made a startling discovery.</p>
<p>The course had been laid out in such a way that
it included a stretch of the swift current which
flowed down-river to the hidden cave.</p>
<p>Ross and Donald obviously were unaware that
their canoe was traveling parallel to the ribbon of
fast water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, directing his companion&rsquo;s
gaze to the current.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>The older boy instantly saw the fast water, and
with a hard surge of the paddle, could have steered
the Den 2 canoe into it. But he hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be fair?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Dan understood what his friend meant. Ross and
Donald were unaware of the fast current which if
utilized, undoubtedly would give a canoeist a decided
advantage.</p>
<p>Once in the swift-moving ribbon of water, the
Den 2 canoe easily might overtake the other craft.
But would it then be a test of skill? Hadn&rsquo;t Mr.
Hatfield said that it wasn&rsquo;t winning that mattered
but the manner in which victory was achieved that
counted?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skip it,&rdquo; he answered Brad&rsquo;s terse question.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll win by our own skill, or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The finish line now was close at hand. Knowing
that the honor of Den 2 depended entirely upon
them, Brad and Dan dug in with their paddles.
They had to win! The Cubs were expecting them to
save the silver plaque. But could they do it? The
race was so short.</p>
<p>Along shore the Cubs of both dens were cheering
for their particular den mates. Dan and Brad heard
the shouts but were only vaguely aware of them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>Slash! Slash! Their paddles lashed the water
cleanly, sending the canoe forward in smooth spurts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it up!&rdquo; Brad encouraged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re gaining!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan nodded, not wasting breath in a reply. The
distance between the two canoes rapidly was dwindling.
If only the finish line were not so close!</p>
<p>Ross and Donald realized they were losing
ground. Uneasily Ross looked over his shoulder to
see how hard they were being pushed. For an instant
he held his paddle, missing a stroke. The bow
swung off course.</p>
<p>Before Ross could bring it back into a straight
line, Dan and Brad surged ahead. The two canoes
raced evenly.</p>
<p>By this time all the Cubs ashore were shouting
like maniacs. &ldquo;Come on Dan! Brad!&rdquo; some of the
boys yelled, while others cheered Donald and Ross
to greater efforts.</p>
<p>The finish line loomed up. An instant before it
was reached, Brad put all his strength into a final
thrust of the paddle. The canoe fairly leaped forward,
crossing the finish line a half length ahead
of the other craft. Den 2 had won! The plaque had
been saved!</p>

<br />THE TURQUOISE TOAD</h2>
<p>Dr. Evans had just come from Webster City
Hospital with a report for Mr. Hatfield concerning
Old Miquel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old fellow&rsquo;s coming around nicely,&rdquo; he informed
the Cub leader. &ldquo;A day or two of complete
bed rest and he&rsquo;ll be as good as ever. Quite a character!
I had a long talk with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Dan guess right about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely. The old coot is a Navajo medicine
man. He carved the face at the ravine though he
has little recollection of doing it. So far as I can
determine, he suffered a severe head blow which
caused a memory lapse. Apparently, he hopped a
freight, and must have been tossed off here at Webster
City. Having no money, he took to living in the
woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you anything about the turquoise,
doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;About the same as Dan learned. The tribal treasure
was entrusted to him. He sticks to his story of
giving it to a trading post man by the name of
Howard Brandall. I wired him and received confirmation.
The turquoise is still in his safe. He didn&rsquo;t
know the tribe considered it lost or stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine!&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said heartily. &ldquo;Then
there&rsquo;s no reason why Old Miquel can&rsquo;t soon return
to the west?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None whatsoever. By the way, what became of
those two Indians who tried to avenge the tribe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White Nose and Eagle Feather? No one has
seen them since they left the cave this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Evans consulted his watch. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now after
four o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he noted. &ldquo;They should be found, if
they&rsquo;re still in Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call the Cubs of both dens together and see
if we can round them up,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield promised.
&ldquo;They should be told the truth about Old Miquel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the Pack ceremonies long since had
ended, nearly all of the Cubs had remained at the
Holloway camp, swimming and enjoying the beach.
By now though, all were dressed in their uniforms
again.</p>
<p>Summoning the Cubs, Mr. Hatfield asked them to
be on the lookout for the two Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Until they&rsquo;re found, it will be unsafe for Old
Miquel to be released from the hospital,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan were especially eager to join in
the search. Their first mission, however, was to
return to Professor Sarazen the Navajo blanket
found in the cave. After that, they went to the
grocery store, thinking that the two Indians might
have been seen there.</p>
<p>The storekeeper informed them that neither
Eagle Feather nor White Nose had returned that
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;ve left town,&rdquo; Dan remarked as the
day wore on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It begins to look that way,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;Since
we can&rsquo;t find &rsquo;em, we&rsquo;ll have to give up the search
for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disheartened, the two friends started for their
homes. The day had been an exciting one, and both
were tired. But they felt highly elated. Not only
had they won the silver plaque for Den 2, but they
had solved the mystery of the strange carved face.
Likewise, they had the satisfaction of knowing that
Old Miquel had been restored to reason.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>Presently the boys drew near the railroad tracks.
A flasher light warned of the approach of a freight
train.</p>
<p>Had they hastened, Dan and Brad could have
crossed ahead of the long, heavy freight. Instead,
being in no hurry, they waited for it to pass.</p>
<p>The train rumbled by, moving slower and slower
as it approached the station. Finally, it came to a
jerky halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ve got to wait,&rdquo; Brad grumbled.</p>
<p>Dan did not answer. His gaze had fastened upon
two lean figures. The men had emerged from behind
the tool house on the railroad right-of-way. He recognized
them as White Nose and Eagle Feather.</p>
<p>As Dan stared in disbelief, the two ran along the
tracks. Finding an open boxcar, they leaped lightly
inside. By now the boy had come to life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick, Brad!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stop
them before they get out of town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older boy also had recognized the two Indians.
With Dan he darted to the boxcar whose
door had been pulled shut from the inside.</p>
<p>The two Cubs pounded on the barrier, calling
upon those inside to &ldquo;open up!&rdquo; When there was no
response, Brad finally managed to shove open the
heavy door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>&ldquo;White Nose! Eagle Feather!&rdquo; he called.</p>
<p>He could not see the two Indians anywhere in
the dark interior of the car. At the same time, the
freight&rsquo;s heavy engine gave a sharp toot. The long
string of cars began to move.</p>
<p>Again Brad shouted to the two Indians. Though
he could not see them, he knew they must be in a
dark corner of the car. The train was moving faster
now.</p>
<p>The Cubs ran to keep up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must stay!&rdquo; Brad shouted. &ldquo;The turquoise
has been found! Old Miquel didn&rsquo;t die! He&rsquo;s told
everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words carried, for from the darkness of the
car, the two Indians suddenly emerged. They stood
framed in the open doorway, and as Brad again
pleaded with them, listened attentively.</p>
<p>The train now was moving so fast that the boys
could not keep up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; Dan gasped. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But even as he spoke, the two Indians leaped
from the train. They landed on their feet and came
back to talk to the boys.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Brad related what had occurred since the two
Indians had left the cave, stressing that Old Miquel
never had been responsible for his strange actions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t punish him for something that wasn&rsquo;t
his fault,&rdquo; he ended. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you go to the hospital
now&mdash;tonight&mdash;and tell Miquel that everything is
all right again? That he can go back to the tribe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We go,&rdquo; White Nose promised. Gravely he and
Eagle Feather shook hands with the two boys
before departing.</p>
<p>Ten days elapsed before the Cubs saw the Indians
again. Their appearance came most unexpectedly at
a weekly meeting of Den 2 at Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little surprise, boys,&rdquo; declared the Cub leader.</p>
<p>He then introduced not only White Nose and
Eagle Feather, but Old Miquel as well. The old
medicine man had almost fully recovered from his
injuries and now was able to be about.</p>
<p>The three Indians made little talks, thanking the
Cubs for the collection of clothing which was to be
sent to the Navajo reservation. White Nose related
the story of why the turquoise toad was so highly
treasured by his people, and ended by presenting
Brad and Dan with small pieces of carved gems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We return to our tribe tomorrow,&rdquo; White Nose
said in conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miquel too?&rdquo; asked Dan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>He was assured that the old medicine man would
accompany his two Indian brothers to New Mexico,
there to resume his rightful place in the tribe.</p>
<p>Never before had the Cubs enjoyed such an unusual
meeting. Not only did the Indians tell them
many fascinating stories, but they recited chants
and gave several dances. Finally, at a late hour, the
meeting broke up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! We really picked ourselves a theme when
we decided to go in for Navajo lore!&rdquo; Dan declared,
collapsing into a chair. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next on the program,
Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s a secret,&rdquo; laughed the Cub leader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it something as exciting as the great carved
face or the cave?&rdquo; demanded Chips eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we couldn&rsquo;t expect to run into anything
like that again in a million years,&rdquo; Midge
protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we could!&rdquo; insisted Red. &ldquo;And we will,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; drawled Mack, &ldquo;with Mr. Hatfield to select
the Cub theme, and Brad and Dan to carry it out,
we&rsquo;re certain to steer a straight course into another
ripping adventure!&rdquo;</p>
